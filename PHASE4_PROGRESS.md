3. **CustomerGroupSeeder** - Customer discount tiers
   - 7 groups: Regular (0%), Bronze (5%), Silver (10%), Gold (15%), VIP (20%), Wholesale (25%), Employee (30%)
   
4. **DatabaseSeeder** (comprehensive) - Orchestrates all seeding
   - Creates complete test dataset with realistic relationships
   - Includes progress indicators and summary statistics

### 🎯 Key Features Implemented

**Factory States & Methods:**
- 100+ factory state methods for different scenarios
- Polymorphic support for Barcode, Inventory, StockMovement, SyncQueue, SyncLog
- Realistic data generation with Faker
- Relationship-aware factories
- Configurable states (active/inactive, pending/completed, etc.)

**Seeding Strategy:**
- Hierarchical seeding (roles → users → categories → products → customers → orders)
- Realistic test data with proper relationships
- Configurable quantities
- Progress indicators during seeding
- Summary statistics after completion

**Data Generated by DatabaseSeeder:**
- 5 users (1 admin, 1 manager, 2 cashiers, 1 inventory manager)
- 20 product categories (5 main + 15 sub)
- 70 products (50 simple + 20 with variants)
- 60-100 product variants
- 100 customers across 7 customer groups
- 60 orders (50 completed + 10 pending)
- 120-300 order items
- 50 payments
- 5 refunds
- 5 held orders
- 12 cash drawer sessions (10 closed + 2 open)
- 24 cash movements
- 40 stock movements

### 📊 Statistics

- **Total Factories**: 18 (1 enhanced + 17 new)
- **Total Seeders**: 4
- **Total Factory States**: 100+
- **Total Permissions**: 24
- **Total Roles**: 4
- **Lines of Code**: ~3,000

## Usage

### Running All Seeders

```bash
# Fresh migration with seeding
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Or run seeder separately
php artisan db:seed
```

### Running Individual Seeders

```bash
# Seed roles and permissions only
php artisan db:seed --class=RoleAndPermissionSeeder

# Seed product categories only
php artisan db:seed --class=ProductCategorySeeder

# Seed customer groups only
php artisan db:seed --class=CustomerGroupSeeder
```

### Using Factories in Tests

```php
// Create a simple product with inventory
$product = Product::factory()
    ->create();

Barcode::factory()->primary()->create([
    'barcodeable_type' => Product::class,
    'barcodeable_id' => $product->id,
]);

Inventory::factory()->wellStocked()->create([
    'inventoriable_type' => Product::class,
    'inventoriable_id' => $product->id,
]);

// Create a product with variants
$product = Product::factory()
    ->withVariants()
    ->create();

$variant = ProductVariant::factory()
    ->withTwoOptions()
    ->create(['product_id' => $product->id]);

// Create a completed order with items
$order = Order::factory()
    ->completed()
    ->create();

OrderItem::factory()
    ->count(3)
    ->create(['order_id' => $order->id]);

Payment::factory()
    ->completed()
    ->create([
        'order_id' => $order->id,
        'amount' => $order->total,
    ]);

// Create users with roles
$admin = User::factory()->admin()->create();
$cashier = User::factory()->cashier()->create();
$manager = User::factory()->manager()->create();

// Create customers with groups
$vipCustomer = Customer::factory()
    ->vip()
    ->withLoyaltyPoints(5000)
    ->create();

$wholesaleCustomer = Customer::factory()
    ->wholesale()
    ->create();
```

## Testing

To test the seeders and factories:

```bash

php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Verify data was created
php artisan tinker
>>> \App\Models\User::count()
>>> \App\Models\Product::count()
>>> \App\Models\Order::count()
>>> \App\Models\Customer::count()
```

## Next Steps

Ready for **Phase 5: API Development** to create RESTful endpoints for all POS operations.

**Overall Progress**: 4/10 phases complete (40%)

## Notes

- All factories support realistic data generation using Faker
- Polymorphic relationships properly handled in factories
- Seeders create hierarchical data with proper relationships
- DatabaseSeeder provides comprehensive test dataset
- All factories include multiple states for different scenarios
- Proper use of callbacks for relationship creation
- Progress indicators during seeding for better UX
