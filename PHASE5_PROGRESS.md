## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"password"}'

# 2. Test products endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

# 3. Test order creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_id":1,"user_id":1,"items":[...]}'
```

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Unit tests for controllers
- Feature tests for endpoints
- Integration tests for workflows
- API response tests
