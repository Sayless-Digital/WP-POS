## 💡 Development Tips

### Service Integration
All services are ready to use via dependency injection:
```php
public function boot(
    CartService $cartService,
    ProductService $productService
) {
    $this->cartService = $cartService;
    $this->productService = $productService;
}
```

### Event Communication
Use Livewire events for component communication:
```php
// Dispatch event
$this->dispatch('event-name', data: $value);

// Listen for event
#[On('event-name')]
public function handleEvent($data) { }
```

### Session Persistence
Save state to session for persistence:
```php
session(['key' => $value]);
$value = session('key', $default);
```

### Validation
Use Livewire validation:
```php
$this->validate([
    'field' => 'required|min:3',
]);
```
