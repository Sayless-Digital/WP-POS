## 🚫 Hostinger Constraints & Solutions

| Constraint | Solution |
|------------|----------|
| No SSH access | Use local development + FTP upload |
| No Composer CLI | Run Composer locally, upload vendor folder |
| No Node.js | Use CDN for Alpine.js, no build step |
| Limited PHP extensions | Use pure PHP alternatives |
| Basic cron jobs | Use Laravel scheduler + external monitoring |

See [Deployment_Hostinger_Guide.md](Deployment_Hostinger_Guide.md) for detailed solutions.
