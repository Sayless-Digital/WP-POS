# Agent Operating Instructions

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST üö®

### MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION UPDATE PROTOCOL

**EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A CODE CHANGE, YOU MUST UPDATE ALL THREE DOCUMENTATION FILES:**

1. ‚úÖ **agents.md** (this file) - System version at line 1792 and version history at line 2327
2. ‚úÖ **docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** - Technical documentation with API details and troubleshooting
3. ‚úÖ **docs/USER_MANUAL.md** - User-facing documentation (if change affects users)

**NO EXCEPTIONS. This is not optional.**

### MANDATORY VERSION NUMBER UPDATE PROTOCOL

**EVERY TIME YOU MODIFY CLIENT-SIDE FILES (main.js, routing.js, etc.), YOU MUST:**

1. ‚úÖ Update version parameter in **index.php** (lines 21-23)
2. ‚úÖ Update system version in **agents.md** (line 1792)
3. ‚úÖ Update "Latest Update" in **agents.md** (line 1794)
4. ‚úÖ Add version history entry in **agents.md** (line 2327)

**Failing to update versions causes browser caching issues where users get old code even after updates.**

### CONSEQUENCES OF SKIPPING THESE STEPS

- ‚ùå **Documentation gaps** - Future developers can't understand system changes
- ‚ùå **Browser caching issues** - Users stuck with old, broken code
- ‚ùå **Lost tracking** - No record of what was changed or why
- ‚ùå **Production failures** - Features don't work because of cached old code

### QUICK CHECKLIST

Before marking ANY task complete, verify:

- [ ] Updated agents.md with version entry and feature summary
- [ ] Updated docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md with technical details
- [ ] Updated docs/USER_MANUAL.md if user-facing change
- [ ] Updated version numbers in index.php if JavaScript/CSS changed
- [ ] Incremented system version in agents.md
- [ ] Added version history entry to agents.md

**If you can't check ALL boxes above, the task is NOT complete.**

### Cross-Referencing Protocol

#### üö® CRITICAL: When Documenting Code Changes

**YOU MUST UPDATE ALL THREE DOCUMENTATION FILES:**

1. ‚úÖ **Update agents.md**: Add to version history (line 2327), update feature summary, update system version (line 1792)
2. ‚úÖ **Update docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md**: Add technical details, API changes, troubleshooting
3. ‚úÖ **Update docs/USER_MANUAL.md** (if user-facing): Add usage instructions, screenshots needs

**This is MANDATORY, not optional. All three files must be kept in sync.**

#### Example Cross-Reference Flow
```markdown
<!-- In agents.md -->
- v1.8.18: Implemented product search optimization with fuzzy matching

<!-- In DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md -->
### Product Search API
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm for typo tolerance
- See [Product Management](docs/USER_MANUAL.md#product-management) for user guide

<!-- In USER_MANUAL.md -->
### Searching Products
- Type product names even with typos - the system automatically corrects them
- Technical details in [API Reference](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#product-endpoints)
```

## Real-Time Documentation Protocols

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Real-Time Documentation Mandate

**YOU MUST DOCUMENT CHANGES AS YOU MAKE THEM, NOT AFTER THE FACT.**

**UPDATE ALL THREE DOCUMENTATION FILES (agents.md, docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, docs/USER_MANUAL.md)**

This means:
- Document **between each discrete change** to the codebase
- Update documentation **before marking a step complete**
- Maintain documentation **during multi-step changes**, not at the end
- Update relevant documentation **immediately after confirming successful tool execution**
- **UPDATE VERSION NUMBERS** in index.php (lines 21-23) if JavaScript/CSS files changed
- **UPDATE SYSTEM VERSION** in agents.md (line 1792) after every change

### What Constitutes a "Change" Requiring Documentation

Every single instance of these actions requires immediate documentation:

1. **File Creation**: New files in [`api/`](api/), [`assets/js/`](assets/js/), [`config/`](config/), [`tests/`](tests/), or root directory
2. **Function Addition**: New functions, methods, or classes
3. **Function Modification**: Changes to function parameters, logic, or return values
4. **API Endpoint Changes**: New endpoints, modified parameters, or changed response formats
5. **Configuration Updates**: Changes to [`config/wp-pos-config.json`](config/wp-pos-config.json:1)
6. **Bug Fixes**: Any correction to existing functionality
7. **Performance Optimizations**: Caching, query optimization, or bundle improvements
8. **Security Changes**: Authentication, validation, or CSRF protection updates
9. **UI Modifications**: Layout, styling, or interaction changes
10. **Database Schema Changes**: New tables, fields, or relationships

### Documentation Workflow

#### Step-by-Step Process

**INCORRECT Approach (Do NOT Do This):**
```
1. Make 5 file changes
2. Test everything
3. Document all changes at once
4. Mark task complete
```

**CORRECT Approach (Always Do This):**
```
1. Make first file change (e.g., create api/new-endpoint.php)
2. ‚úÖ Confirm tool execution succeeded
3. üìù DOCUMENT: Update agents.md version history (line 2327)
4. üìù DOCUMENT: Update agents.md system version (line 1792)
5. üìù DOCUMENT: Add to docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md API Reference
6. üìù DOCUMENT: Update docs/USER_MANUAL.md if user-facing

7. Make second file change (e.g., update assets/js/main.js)
8. ‚úÖ Confirm tool execution succeeded
9. üìù UPDATE VERSION: Increment version in index.php (lines 21-23)
10. üìù DOCUMENT: Update agents.md feature summary
11. üìù DOCUMENT: Add troubleshooting notes to DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md if applicable

12. Continue pattern for each change...
```

#### Autonomous Work Sessions

During autonomous multi-step work, you must:

1. **Pause after each logical unit**: After creating a file, modifying a function, or fixing a bug
2. **Document immediately**: Update all relevant documentation files
3. **Verify documentation**: Ensure cross-references are correct
4. **Continue to next unit**: Only proceed after documentation is complete

**Example Autonomous Session:**
```
Task: "Add product export functionality"

Step 1: Create api/export-products.php
- Wait for confirmation: "File created successfully"
- Update agents.md: Line in File Structure, new API endpoint, version history (line 2327)
- Update agents.md: System version (line 1792)
- Update docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Add to API Reference with examples
- Update docs/USER_MANUAL.md: Add to Product Management section

Step 2: Add export button to products page
- Wait for confirmation: "File modified successfully"
- Update version in index.php (line 23) if JavaScript changed
- Update agents.md: Add to Features section
- Update docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Add UI interaction notes
- Update docs/USER_MANUAL.md: Add step-by-step export instructions

Step 3: Test export functionality
- Execute test command
- Wait for confirmation: "Test passed"
- Update agents.md: Add to Testing section
- Document any edge cases found in docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
```

### Documentation Checkpoints

Before proceeding to the next change, verify:

- [ ] All affected documentation files identified

## Concrete Examples

### Example 1: Feature Implementation with Proper Documentation

**Scenario:** Adding a product search autocomplete feature

#### Step 1: Implement Backend API
```bash
# Create new API endpoint
write_to_file api/product-autocomplete.php
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`agents.md`](agents.md:1):
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Implemented product search autocomplete with real-time suggestions
```

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
#### GET /api/product-autocomplete.php

Returns product suggestions based on partial search input.

**Query Parameters:**
- `query`: (required) Search term (minimum 2 characters)
- `limit`: (optional) Maximum suggestions to return, default: 10

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "suggestions": [
            {"id": 123, "name": "Product Name", "sku": "SKU123"},
            {"id": 124, "name": "Another Product", "sku": "SKU124"}
        ],
        "count": 2
    }
}
```
```

#### Step 2: Implement Frontend Component
```bash
# Modify main JavaScript
apply_diff assets/js/main.js
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Product Search Autocomplete

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Implemented in [`main.js`](../assets/js/main.js:567)
async function handleSearchAutocomplete(query) {
    if (query.length < 2) return [];
    
    const response = await fetch(`/api/product-autocomplete.php?query=${query}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    return data.success ? data.data.suggestions : [];
}
```

**Usage:** Type at least 2 characters in product search to see suggestions
```

Update [`USER_MANUAL.md`](docs/USER_MANUAL.md:1):
```markdown
### Product Search Autocomplete (New in v1.8.18)

As you type in the product search box, you'll see real-time suggestions:

1. Type at least 2 characters in the search box
2. Suggestions appear automatically below the search input
3. Click any suggestion to select that product
4. Press ESC to close suggestions without selecting

**Note:** Suggestions are based on product names and SKUs.
```

#### Step 3: Test Implementation
```bash
# Run tests
execute_command php tests/php/test-autocomplete.php
```

**After Test Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Testing Product Autocomplete

```bash
php tests/php/test-autocomplete.php
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Empty query handling
- Single character rejection
- Valid query suggestions
- Result limit enforcement
- Special character handling
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix with Incremental Documentation

**Scenario:** Fixing cart total calculation error

#### Step 1: Identify and Document Problem
**Before Fixing:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1) Troubleshooting:
```markdown
#### Cart Total Calculation Error (v1.8.18)
- **Problem**: Cart displays incorrect total when discount codes are applied
- **Symptoms**: Total shows higher amount than expected, ignores percentage discounts
- **Root Cause**: INVESTIGATING...
```

#### Step 2: Fix the Code
```bash
# Fix the calculation function
apply_diff assets/js/modules/cart.js
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
#### Cart Total Calculation Error (v1.8.18)
- **Problem**: Cart displays incorrect total when discount codes are applied
- **Symptoms**: Total shows higher amount than expected, ignores percentage discounts
- **Root Cause**: Discount percentage was being added instead of subtracted in [`calculateCartTotal()`](../assets/js/modules/cart.js:234)
- **Solution**: Fixed line 234 from `total += discount` to `total -= discount`
- **Prevention**: Added unit tests for discount calculations in [`test-cart.js`](../tests/js/test-cart.js:1)

**Before:**
```javascript
function calculateCartTotal() {
    let total = subtotal;
    if (discount > 0) total += discount; // BUG: Should subtract
    return total;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function calculateCartTotal() {
    let total = subtotal;
    if (discount > 0) total -= discount; // FIXED: Now correctly subtracts
    return total;
}
```
```

Update [`agents.md`](agents.md:1):
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Fixed cart total calculation bug - discount percentages now correctly subtracted instead of added
```

#### Step 3: Add Test
```bash
# Create test for the fix
write_to_file tests/js/test-cart-discount.js
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Testing Cart Calculations

```bash
# Run cart tests
node tests/js/test-runner.js test-cart-discount.js
```

**Test Cases:**
- Percentage discount: 10% off $100 = $90
- Fixed amount discount: $10 off $100 = $90
- Multiple discounts: Correctly applies both
- Edge case: 100% discount = $0
```

### Example 3: Configuration Change Documentation

**Scenario:** Adding new cache configuration option

#### Step 1: Update Configuration File
```bash
# Modify config
apply_diff config/wp-pos-config.json
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`agents.md`](agents.md:1):
```markdown
- v1.8.19: Fixed things
- v1.8.20: Made improvements
```

**Why Wrong:** No actionable information, no searchability, no learning value

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Descriptive Version History
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Implemented product search autocomplete - real-time suggestions appear after typing 2+ characters, using new [`/api/product-autocomplete.php`](api/product-autocomplete.php:1) endpoint
- v1.8.19: Fixed cart total calculation in [`calculateCartTotal()`](assets/js/modules/cart.js:234) - discount percentages now correctly subtracted (was adding), added unit tests
- v1.8.20: Added `cache.cleanup_on_startup` boolean to [`wp-pos-config.json`](config/wp-pos-config.json:1) - controls automatic cache cleanup at application start, defaults to true
```

#### ‚ùå WRONG: No Cross-References
```markdown
### New Feature

Added product export functionality. It's in the API somewhere and there's a button for it.
```

**Why Wrong:** No file references, no line numbers, impossible to locate in codebase

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Complete Cross-References
```markdown
### Product Export (v1.8.18)

**Implementation:**
- API Endpoint: [`/api/export-products.php`](api/export-products.php:1)
- Frontend Handler: [`handleProductExport()`](assets/js/main.js:789)
- UI Button: Added to products page at [`index.php`](index.php:456) line 456
- Configuration: Uses `export.format` from [`wp-pos-config.json`](config/wp-pos-config.json:23)

**Related Documentation:**
- Technical details: [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md - Export API](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#export-api)
- User guide: [USER_MANUAL.md - Exporting Products](docs/USER_MANUAL.md#exporting-products)
```

## Version Management & Cache Busting Protocol

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Version Updates are MANDATORY

**YOU MUST UPDATE VERSION NUMBERS AFTER EVERY CHANGE THAT AFFECTS CLIENT-SIDE FILES.**

Failing to update versions will cause:
- ‚ùå Users seeing cached old code even after updates
- ‚ùå JavaScript errors from mismatched file versions
- ‚ùå Features not working in production
- ‚ùå Cache-related bugs that are extremely difficult to debug

**This is NOT optional. Version updates are as important as the code changes themselves.**

---

### Current Versioning System

WP POS uses **query parameter versioning** for cache busting:

**How It Works:**
```html
<!-- Version parameters force browser to download new files -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.10"></script>
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Browsers cache JavaScript files aggressively
- Without version changes, users get old cached code
- Version parameter change = browser treats it as a new file
- Forces fresh download = users always get latest code

**Current Versions (as of latest update):**
- System Version: `v1.8.26` (in [`agents.md`](agents.md:1792))
- Main JavaScript: `v1.8.26` (in [`index.php`](index.php:23))
- Routing Module: `v1.5.11` (in [`index.php`](index.php:21))

---

### When to Update Versions

#### Major Version (X.0.0) - Breaking Changes
**Update when:**
- Complete system rewrites or major architecture changes
- Breaking API changes that affect all consumers
- Removal of deprecated features that break existing functionality
- Database schema changes requiring migrations
- Changes to core authentication or security systems

**Examples:**
- `1.8.17` ‚Üí `2.0.0`: Complete rewrite from jQuery to vanilla JavaScript
- `2.0.0` ‚Üí `3.0.0`: Migration from REST API to GraphQL

**Impact:** Requires user action, may need data migration, extensive testing needed

---

#### Minor Version (0.X.0) - New Features
**Update when:**
- Adding new features or significant enhancements
- New API endpoints or major functionality additions
- UI/UX improvements that change user workflows
- Performance optimizations with measurable impact
- New configuration options or settings

**Examples:**
- `1.8.17` ‚Üí `1.9.0`: Added comprehensive reporting system with charts
- `1.6.5` ‚Üí `1.7.0`: Implemented product search autocomplete

**Impact:** Backward compatible, enhances functionality, no breaking changes

---

#### Patch Version (0.0.X) - Bug Fixes & Minor Updates
**Update when:**
- Bug fixes that don't change functionality
- Minor styling or layout adjustments
- Performance tweaks without major impact
- Documentation updates (code comments, inline docs)
- Dependency updates that don't change behavior
- Security patches

**Examples:**
- `1.8.17` ‚Üí `1.8.18`: Fixed cart total calculation bug
- `1.8.18` ‚Üí `1.8.19`: Updated button styling for consistency

**Impact:** Backward compatible, fixes issues, minimal risk

---

### How to Update Versions

#### Step 1: Determine Version Increment Type

**Ask yourself:**
- Does this break existing functionality? ‚Üí **Major**
- Does this add new features? ‚Üí **Minor**
- Does this fix bugs or make minor changes? ‚Üí **Patch**

#### Step 2: Update Version in index.php

**Location:** [`index.php`](index.php:21-23)

**For JavaScript file changes:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>

<!-- AFTER (for patch) -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.18"></script>
```

**For routing module changes:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.10"></script>

<!-- AFTER (for patch) -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.11"></script>
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**
- Update ONLY the file(s) you modified
- If you change `main.js`, update `main.js` version
- If you change `routing.js`, update `routing.js` version
- If you change both, update both versions

#### Step 3: Update System Version in agents.md

**Location:** [`agents.md`](agents.md:1290) (System Overview section)

**Update the "Current System Status" section:**
```markdown
<!-- BEFORE -->
**Version**: 1.8.18

<!-- AFTER -->
**Version**: 1.8.19
```

**Update the "Latest Update" line:**
```markdown
<!-- BEFORE -->
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.8.18 - [previous feature description]

<!-- AFTER -->
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.8.19 - [your new feature/fix description]
```

#### Step 4: Add Version History Entry

**Location:** [`agents.md`](agents.md:1823) (bottom of file)

**Add new line to Version History section:**
```markdown
## Version History

- v1.8.19: [Brief description] - [technical details with file links]
- v1.8.18: Implemented comprehensive reporting system - added [`/api/reports.php`]...
```

**Format:**
```markdown
- v1.X.X: [What changed] - [Why/How with file references]
```

#### Step 5: Update DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (If Applicable)

**Location:** [`docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1)

**Add version reference in relevant section:**
```markdown
### Feature Name (v1.8.19)
[Feature documentation with version number]
```

### Cache Busting Mechanism Explained

#### How Browser Caching Works
```
User visits site
    ‚Üì
Browser checks: "Do I have main.js?v=1.8.17 cached?"
    ‚Üì
YES ‚Üí Use cached version (FAST but may be outdated)
NO  ‚Üí Download from server (SLOW but always current)
```

#### How Version Changes Force Updates
```
You deploy: main.js?v=1.8.18 (version changed)
    ‚Üì
User visits site
    ‚Üì
Browser checks: "Do I have main.js?v=1.8.18 cached?"
    ‚Üì
NO (because v1.8.18 is NEW) ‚Üí Downloads fresh version
    ‚Üì
User gets latest code! ‚úÖ
```

#### What Happens Without Version Updates
```
You deploy: main.js (code updated, but version still v1.8.17)
    ‚Üì
User visits site
    ‚Üì
Browser checks: "Do I have main.js?v=1.8.17 cached?"
    ‚Üì
YES (same version!) ‚Üí Uses OLD cached code
    ‚Üì
User gets outdated code! ‚ùå
Result: New features don't work, bugs aren't fixed
```

- [ ] Documentation references correct version numbers

---

### Examples

#### Example 1: Bug Fix (Patch Version)

**Scenario:** Fixed cart total calculation error

**Version Update:**
```html
<!-- index.php line 23 -->
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>

<!-- AFTER -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.18"></script>
```

**agents.md System Overview (line 1290):**
```markdown
**Version**: 1.8.18
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.8.18 - Fixed cart total calculation bug where discount percentages were added instead of subtracted
```

**agents.md Version History (line 1823):**
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Fixed cart total calculation in [`calculateCartTotal()`](assets/js/modules/cart.js:234) - discount percentages now correctly subtracted (was adding), added unit tests
```

---

#### Example 2: New Feature (Minor Version)

**Scenario:** Added product search autocomplete

**Version Update:**
```html
<!-- index.php line 23 -->
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>

<!-- AFTER -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.9.0"></script>
```

**agents.md System Overview (line 1290):**
```markdown
**Version**: 1.9.0
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.9.0 - Implemented product search autocomplete with real-time suggestions appearing after 2+ characters
```

**agents.md Version History (line 1823):**
```markdown
- v1.9.0: Implemented product search autocomplete - real-time suggestions appear after typing 2+ characters, using new [`/api/product-autocomplete.php`](api/product-autocomplete.php:1) endpoint with [`handleSearchAutocomplete()`](assets/js/main.js:567) frontend handler
```

---

#### Example 3: Multiple File Changes

**Scenario:** Updated both main.js and routing.js

**Version Update:**
```html
<!-- index.php lines 21-23 -->
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.10"></script>
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>

<!-- AFTER -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.11"></script>
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.18"></script>
```

**agents.md Update:**
```markdown
**Version**: 1.8.18
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.8.18 - Enhanced routing system with improved error handling and updated main navigation logic

## Version History
- v1.8.18: Enhanced routing system - improved error handling in [`routing.js`](assets/js/modules/routing.js:1) and updated navigation logic in [`main.js`](assets/js/main.js:1)
```

---

#### Example 4: Version Number in URLs

**How versions appear in browser:**
```
https://example.com/wp-pos/assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.18
                                                  ‚Üë
                                        Cache busting parameter
```

**Browser treats these as DIFFERENT files:**
- `main.js?v=1.8.17` ‚Üê Old version (cached)
- `main.js?v=1.8.18` ‚Üê New version (forces download)

---

### Integration with Existing Documentation Protocols

#### During Real-Time Documentation (Section 3)

**Add version update as a documentation step:**
```
1. Make code change to main.js
2. ‚úÖ Confirm tool execution succeeded
3. üìù UPDATE VERSION: Increment main.js version in index.php
4. üìù DOCUMENT: Update agents.md version history
5. üìù DOCUMENT: Add to DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md with version reference
```

#### In Documentation Templates (Section 4)

**Update "New Feature" template to include:**
```markdown
**agents.md Entry:**
- v1.X.X: [Feature name] - [Description] with file links
- **Files Changed**: [`file.js`](path/file.js:1) (v1.X.X)
- **Version Update**: Updated from v1.X.X to v1.X.X in [`index.php`](index.php:23)
```

#### In Interconnected Changes (Section 7)

**Add to Phase 6: Final Documentation Pass:**
```markdown
#### Phase 6: Version Update & Final Documentation
- [ ] Version numbers updated in index.php
- [ ] System version updated in agents.md
- [ ] Version history entry added
- [ ] All version references consistent
- [ ] [Continue with existing cross-reference checks...]
```

---

### Common Version Update Mistakes

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 1: Not updating version at all
```html
<!-- You changed main.js but didn't update version -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>
```
**Result:** Users get cached old code, new features don't work

---

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 2: Wrong version increment
```html
<!-- Bug fix but incremented major version -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=2.0.0"></script>
```
**Result:** Confusing version history, breaks semantic versioning

---

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 3: Updating wrong file version
```html
<!-- You changed main.js but updated routing.js version -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.11"></script>
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script> <!-- Should be 1.8.18! -->
```
**Result:** Browser doesn't re-download the changed file

---

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 4: Inconsistent version numbers
```markdown
<!-- index.php says v1.8.18 but agents.md says v1.8.19 -->
```
**Result:** Documentation doesn't match deployed version

---

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 5: Skipping version history entry
```markdown
<!-- Updated version in index.php but no history entry in agents.md -->
```
**Result:** No record of what changed, impossible to track features

---

### Version Update Quick Reference

| Change Type | Example | Version Change | Update Files |
|-------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Bug Fix** | Fixed calculation error | 1.8.17 ‚Üí 1.8.18 | index.php, agents.md |
| **New Feature** | Added autocomplete | 1.8.17 ‚Üí 1.9.0 | index.php, agents.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md |
| **Breaking Change** | Complete rewrite | 1.8.17 ‚Üí 2.0.0 | index.php, agents.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, USER_MANUAL.md |
| **Minor Update** | Updated styling | 1.8.17 ‚Üí 1.8.18 | index.php, agents.md |
| **Module Change** | Fixed routing bug | routing: 1.5.10 ‚Üí 1.5.11 | index.php, agents.md |

---

### Testing Version Updates

#### Manual Verification

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check Network tab** in DevTools
4. **Verify** new version parameter in requests:
   ```
   Request URL: .../main.js?v=1.8.18
   Status: 200 (from server, not cache)
   ```

#### Automated Testing

Add version verification to your test suite:
```javascript
// Check that version was updated
test('Version updated after changes', () => {
    const scriptTag = document.querySelector('script[src*="main.js"]');
    const version = scriptTag.src.match(/v=(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)/)[1];
    
    // Verify version is greater than previous
    assert(version === '1.8.18', 'Version should be updated');
});
```

---

### Emergency Version Rollback

**If you need to rollback to a previous version:**

1. **Revert code changes** to previous version
2. **DO NOT revert version number** - increment forward instead
3. **Document the rollback:**
   ```markdown
   - v1.8.19: Rolled back autocomplete feature from v1.8.18 due to performance issues
   ```
4. **Add explanation** in DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md troubleshooting section

**Why not revert version numbers?**
- Users may have cached the "bad" version
- Going backward (1.8.18 ‚Üí 1.8.17) won't force cache refresh
- Always increment forward (1.8.18 ‚Üí 1.8.19) to ensure fresh download

---

### Summary: Version Management Rules

1. **Always update versions** when changing client-side code
2. **Update immediately** after confirming code change success
3. **Be consistent** across index.php and documentation
4. **Follow semantic versioning** (major.minor.patch)
5. **Document the change** in version history
6. **Test cache busting** works after update
7. **Never skip versions** - increment sequentially
8. **Never revert versions** - always move forward

**Remember: Version updates are not optional. They are critical for production deployments.**

## Interconnected Changes Protocol

### Understanding Interconnected Changes

Many changes in this codebase affect multiple components. When making interconnected changes, you must maintain consistency across all affected files and documentation.

#### Common Interconnection Patterns

1. **API + Frontend + Documentation**
   - API endpoint change ‚Üí Frontend consuming code ‚Üí User documentation
   - Example: Changing product API response format

2. **Configuration + Implementation + Documentation**
   - Config file ‚Üí Code reading config ‚Üí Developer guide ‚Üí User manual
   - Example: Adding new cache setting

3. **Database + API + Frontend**
   - Schema change ‚Üí API query ‚Üí Frontend display
   - Example: Adding new product field

4. **State Management + Components**
   - appState structure ‚Üí Multiple components using state
   - Example: Adding new cart property

### Protocol for Interconnected Changes

#### Step 1: Identify All Affected Components

Before making ANY change, list all affected components:

**Example: Adding product "favorite" functionality**
```
Affected Components:
- Database: wp_postmeta (new meta field)
- API: api/products.php (return favorite status)
- Frontend: assets/js/modules/products.js (display star icon)
- State: assets/js/modules/state.js (track favorites)
- UI: index.php (favorite button)
- Config: config/wp-pos-config.json (favorite settings)
- Docs: All three documentation files
```

#### Step 2: Plan Change Sequence

Order changes to maintain system functionality:

```
1. Database/Backend first (foundation)
2. API layer (interface)
3. Frontend/State (consumption)
4. UI (presentation)
5. Documentation (explanation)
```

#### Step 3: Implement with Incremental Documentation

For each component change:
1. Make the change
2. Confirm success
3. Document immediately (all relevant docs)
4. Verify related components still compatible
5. Move to next component

#### Step 4: Cross-Reference Updates

After all changes complete, verify all cross-references:

**Checklist:**
- [ ] agents.md updated with version entry
- [ ] agents.md features list updated
- [ ] agents.md file structure updated (if new files)
- [ ] DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md API section updated (if API changed)
- [ ] DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md architecture updated (if structure changed)
- [ ] DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md troubleshooting added (for new issues)
- [ ] USER_MANUAL.md usage instructions added (if user-facing)
- [ ] USER_MANUAL.md troubleshooting updated (for user issues)
- [ ] All code files have proper comments referencing docs
- [ ] All docs have proper markdown links to code files

### Example: Complete Interconnected Change

**Task:** Add product rating system

#### Phase 1: Database Layer
```bash
# Modify database schema

  ```markdown
  **Response includes new field:**
  ```json
  {
      "rating": 4.5,
      "rating_count": 28
  }
  ```
  ```

#### Phase 3: State Management
```bash
# Add rating to appState
apply_diff assets/js/modules/state.js
```

**Document Immediately:**
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Update State Management section
  ```markdown
  ### appState Structure
  ```javascript
  appState.products = {
      all: [],
      current: null,
      rating: null  // NEW: Current product rating
  };
  ```
  ```

#### Phase 4: Frontend Display
```bash
# Add star rating display

```

**Document Immediately:**
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Add UI implementation notes
- USER_MANUAL.md: Add to Product Information section

#### Phase 5: Configuration
```bash
# Add rating settings
apply_diff config/wp-pos-config.json
```

**Document Immediately:**
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Add configuration documentation
- agents.md: Update configuration summary

#### Phase 6: Final Documentation Pass

**Verify all cross-references:**
```markdown
<!-- agents.md -->
- v1.9.0: Implemented product rating system with 5-star display, average calculation, and user review counting

<!-- DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md -->
### Product Rating System (v1.9.0)
- API returns rating data in [`/api/products.php`](../api/products.php:1)
- State managed in [`appState.products.rating`](../assets/js/modules/state.js:45)
- Display handled by [`renderProductRating()`](../assets/js/modules/products.js:234)
- Configuration in [`config/wp-pos-config.json`](../config/wp-pos-config.json:67)

<!-- USER_MANUAL.md -->
### Product Ratings (New in v1.9.0)
Each product displays its average rating based on customer reviews:
1. Look for the star rating below the product name
2. See the number of reviews in parentheses
3. Click the rating to see detailed reviews
For technical implementation, see [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#product-rating-system)
```

# WP POS (WordPress Point of Sale) - Complete System Documentation

- v1.8.18: Added `cache.cleanup_on_startup` configuration option to control automatic cache cleanup behavior
```

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Configuration: cache.cleanup_on_startup

**Purpose:** Controls whether cache is automatically cleaned up when the application starts

**Type:** boolean

**Default Value:** `true`

**Location:** [`config/wp-pos-config.json`](../config/wp-pos-config.json:1)

**Example:**
```json
{
    "cache": {
        "enabled": true,
        "default_ttl": 300,
        "cleanup_on_startup": false
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- `true`: Cache is cleaned on every application start (removes expired entries)
- `false`: Cache cleanup only happens on scheduled intervals

**When to Disable:** 
- High-traffic environments where startup cleanup causes delays
- When using external cache management tools
- During development to preserve cache across restarts

**Related Code:**
- Implemented in [`cache-manager.php`](../api/cache-manager.php:45) line 45
- Called from [`index.php`](../index.php:12) during initialization
```

#### Step 2: Update Implementation
```bash
# Modify cache manager to use new config
apply_diff api/cache-manager.php
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Cache Manager Implementation

The [`WP-POS_Cache_Manager`](../api/cache-manager.php:15) class respects the `cleanup_on_startup` configuration:

```php
class WP-POS_Cache_Manager {
    public function __construct() {
        $config = $this->load_config();
        
        if ($config['cache']['cleanup_on_startup'] === true) {
            $this->cleanup_expired();
        }
    }
}
## Version 1.9.151 (2025-10-09)
**Enhanced Attribute Name Selection with Searchable Dropdowns**
- Added searchable dropdown for attribute name selection when adding new attributes
- Fetches available attributes from WooCommerce (both global taxonomy and custom attributes)
- Type-to-search functionality filters attributes in real-time
- Shows attribute type (Global vs Custom) for clarity
- Option to create new custom attribute if not found in suggestions
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter to select, Escape to close)
- Visual feedback with green border on selection
- Consistent UX with variation attribute selectors
- API endpoint `/api/product-edit-simple.php?action=get_available_attributes` provides attribute list

**Technical Implementation:**
- New `setupAttributeNameSearchHandler()` method in [`product-editor.js`](assets/js/modules/products/product-editor.js:510)
- Async fetch of available attributes in [`addAttributeRow()`](assets/js/modules/products/product-editor.js:417)
- Real-time filtering with case-insensitive search
- Stores selected attribute metadata (name, label, type) in data attributes
- Click handlers for both existing attributes and "create new" option

## Version 1.9.34 (2025-10-07)
**Separate Flat/Percentage Values and Proper Formatting**
- Separate value storage for flat vs percentage tabs - switching between tabs preserves both values
- Flat dollar amounts display as "$X.XX", percentages display as "X%"
- Modal always opens with "Flat" tab selected by default
- Switching tabs loads the appropriate saved value for that type
- Cart display shows proper formatting: "-10%" or "-$5.00" based on type
- Only creates fee/discount from the currently active tab type

```

**Configuration-Aware Behavior:** Cache manager checks configuration before performing startup cleanup
```

### Counter-Examples (INCORRECT Approaches)

#### ‚ùå WRONG: Documenting Multiple Changes at Once
```markdown
<!-- DO NOT DO THIS -->
- v1.8.18: Added autocomplete, fixed cart bug, updated cache config, improved performance, refactored API, updated tests
```

**Why Wrong:** Too vague, no detail, loses track of individual changes

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Individual Documentation
```markdown
<!-- DO THIS INSTEAD -->
- v1.8.18: Implemented product search autocomplete with real-time suggestions using new /api/product-autocomplete.php endpoint
- v1.8.19: Fixed cart total calculation bug where discount percentages were added instead of subtracted
- v1.8.20: Added cache.cleanup_on_startup configuration option to control automatic cache cleanup behavior
```

#### ‚ùå WRONG: Documentation After All Changes
```
1. Create 5 new files
2. Modify 3 existing files
3. Test everything
4. Write all documentation at the end
```

**Why Wrong:** Violates real-time documentation protocol, risks missing details

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Documentation Between Each Change
```
1. Create api/endpoint1.php ‚Üí Document immediately
2. Create api/endpoint2.php ‚Üí Document immediately
3. Modify assets/js/main.js ‚Üí Document immediately
4. Test endpoint1 ‚Üí Document test results
5. Test endpoint2 ‚Üí Document test results
```

#### ‚ùå WRONG: Vague Version History
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Updated some stuff
- v1.8.19: Fixed things

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode in configuration for detailed error information and logging.

### Routing System Troubleshooting
If views are not loading data properly:

1. **Check Global Functions**: Ensure all required functions are globally available:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Available functions:', {
     fetchOrders: typeof window.fetchOrders,
     fetchReportsData: typeof window.fetchReportsData,
     fetchSessions: typeof window.fetchSessions,
     renderStockList: typeof window.renderStockList,
     populateSettingsForm: typeof window.populateSettingsForm,
     renderHeldCarts: typeof window.renderHeldCarts
   });
   ```

2. **Verify Function Assignment**: Functions are assigned at the end of main.js execution
3. **Check Console Errors**: Look for "function not found" warnings in browser console
4. **URL Parameters**: Ensure views are accessed via proper URL parameters (`?view=view-name`)

### Monitoring
Use the built-in monitoring system to track system health, performance metrics, and error rates.

- **v1.9.104** (2025-10-08): Redesigned Role Management with Dialog Interface and Better Organization - completely redesigned roles UI at [`index.php:824-1017`](index.php:824-1017) with cleaner single-column layout instead of complex 3-column grid, renamed "Quick Start Helper" to "Predefined Role Templates" and moved to top of page for better information architecture, role creation now uses modal dialog overlay instead of sidebar panel providing better focus and accessibility, "Create Custom Role" button in header opens dialog at [`index.php:969-1017`](index.php:969-1017) with full-screen overlay and smooth animations, dialog includes overlay click-to-close, escape key support, and form reset on open/close, custom roles list displayed in dedicated section with loading states and empty states, improved visual hierarchy with better spacing and consistent card design across templates and custom roles, templates section now collapsible showing enhanced role cards with capability counts (All Capabilities, 6 Capabilities, 4 Capabilities) instead of verbose listings, removed sticky sidebar and mobile-specific hide/show logic for simpler responsive design, updated JavaScript handlers in [`settings.js:375-449,486-496`](assets/js/modules/admin/settings.js:375-449) to work with dialog system (show/hide dialog buttons, overlay click detection, form submission closes dialog automatically, cancel button functionality), maintains keyboard auto-show toggle functionality from v1.9.103, updated cache-busting version to v1.9.104 for [`settings.js`](index.php:49), provides cleaner UX with modal-focused workflow instead of always-visible sidebar panel

- **v1.9.101** (2025-10-08): Fixed Checkout 403 Error Caused by Nonce Name Mismatch - resolved critical bug preventing all checkout transactions where nonce verification was failing at [`api/checkout.php:23`](api/checkout.php:23), root cause was mismatch between nonce generation in [`index.php:264`](index.php:264) using `wppos_checkout_nonce` and verification in checkout.php using `jpos_checkout_nonce`, corrected checkout.php to use `wppos_checkout_nonce` matching the generated nonce name, checkout now processes successfully after fixing nonce verification, also fixed settings page loading issue where input fields showed empty values - added `await settingsManager.loadReceiptSettings()` at [`main.js:40`](assets/js/main.js:40) to load settings into state during initialization, settings now properly populate via [`populateSettingsForm()`](assets/js/modules/admin/settings.js:54-89), completed RBAC infrastructure with capability checking methods [`userCan()`](assets/js/modules/auth.js:351-361), menu visibility restrictions via [`applyRBACRestrictions()`](assets/js/main.js:146-221), WordPress administrators and shop_manager bypass all restrictions with full access, updated cache-busting versions to v1.9.101 for [`checkout.js`](index.php:37), [`settings.js`](index.php:49), and [`main.js`](index.php:53)

- **v1.9.91** (2025-10-08): Fixed Settings Form Loading & Added RBAC UI Restrictions with Admin Bypass - resolved critical bug where settings form showed empty input fields despite saved values existing, modified [`populateSettingsForm()`](assets/js/modules/admin/settings.js:54-89) to reload settings from API via [`loadReceiptSettings()`](assets/js/modules/admin/settings.js:14-49) before populating form ensuring fresh data, added comprehensive RBAC frontend integration with capability checking methods [`userCan()`](assets/js/modules/auth.js:351-361), [`userCanAny()`](assets/js/modules/auth.js:368-370), [`userCanAll()`](assets/js/modules/auth.js:377-379), [`hasRole()`](assets/js/modules/auth.js:402-405) to [`AuthManager`](assets/js/modules/auth.js:7-406) class with global wrapper functions, implemented menu visibility restrictions via [`applyRBACRestrictions()`](assets/js/main.js:146-187) function that hides Reports/Sessions/Settings/Products menu items based on capabilities, **WordPress administrators and shop_manager role automatically bypass all restrictions and see everything** via early return check at [`main.js:148-152`](assets/js/main.js:148-152), restrictions applied after successful login in [`loadFullApp()`](assets/js/modules/auth.js:249-310) and during event setup in [`setupAllEventListeners()`](assets/js/main.js:185-516), updated cache-busting versions to v1.9.91 for [`auth.js`](index.php:28), [`settings.js`](index.php:49), and [`main.js`](index.php:53)

- **v1.9.74** (2025-10-07): Fixed Settings Page Not Loading Input Values and Saved Settings - resolved critical issue where settings page showed empty input fields instead of current saved values, root cause was settings never being loaded into application state during initialization at [`main.js:41`](assets/js/main.js:41), added `await settingsManager.loadReceiptSettings()` to load settings from API into state immediately after SettingsManager initialization, settings now properly populate all input fields (store name, email, phone, address, receipt footer messages, virtual keyboard checkboxes) when navigating to settings page via [`populateSettingsForm()`](assets/js/modules/admin/settings.js:54-89) exposed at [`main.js:59`](assets/js/main.js:59), updated cache-busting versions to v1.9.74 for [`settings.js`](index.php:49) and [`main.js`](index.php:53)

- **v1.9.73** (2025-10-07): Fixed Virtual Keyboard Auto-Show Implementation - resolved critical issue where virtual keyboard auto-show setting was not working due to missing [`initKeyboardAutoShow()`](assets/js/modules/keyboard.js:207) function referenced but never implemented in codebase, added comprehensive auto-show functionality in [`keyboard.js:207-258`](assets/js/modules/keyboard.js:207) with focus/blur listener management for all text/email/search inputs excluding product editor and fee/discount modals, implemented [`initAutoShow()`](assets/js/modules/keyboard.js:207) method that checks settings and attaches listeners when both `virtual_keyboard_enabled` and `virtual_keyboard_auto_show` are true, added [`removeAutoShowListeners()`](assets/js/modules/keyboard.js:249) for proper cleanup, exposed global [`window.initKeyboardAutoShow()`](assets/js/modules/keyboard.js:263) helper function called by [`settings.js:24,46,76,172`](assets/js/modules/admin/settings.js:24) after loading/saving settings, corrected API endpoint paths in [`settings.js:16,150`](assets/js/modules/admin/settings.js:16) from absolute `/jpos/api/settings.php` to relative `api/settings.php` for proper routing, fixed incorrect element IDs in [`settings.js:133-134`](assets/js/modules/admin/settings.js:133) from `enable-virtual-keyboard`/`auto-show-keyboard` to correct `setting-keyboard-enabled`/`setting-keyboard-auto-show` matching HTML checkboxes in [`index.php:780,786`](index.php:780), updated cache-busting versions to v1.9.73 for [`keyboard.js`](index.php:29) and [`settings.js`](index.php:49), virtual keyboard settings now save correctly to database via [`api/settings.php:66-71`](api/settings.php:66-71), auto-show functionality properly initializes on app load and after settings changes, keyboard appears automatically when clicking input fields when enabled

- **v1.9.72** (2025-10-07): Completed JavaScript Modularization Refactoring - successfully finished comprehensive refactoring project that transformed monolithic 4,997-line [`main.js`](assets/js/main.js:1) into modular architecture with 14 focused modules, reduced main.js by 90.7% to 466 lines functioning as pure orchestrator coordinating manager instances and event delegation, created modules: [`state.js`](assets/js/modules/state.js:1) (219 lines centralized state management), [`routing.js`](assets/js/modules/routing.js:1) (227 lines URL-based navigation), [`ui-helpers.js`](assets/js/modules/core/ui-helpers.js:1) (229 lines shared utilities), [`auth.js`](assets/js/modules/auth.js:1) (265 lines authentication), [`keyboard.js`](assets/js/modules/keyboard.js:1) (217 lines virtual keyboard), [`drawer.js`](assets/js/modules/financial/drawer.js:1) (217 lines cash drawer), [`cart.js`](assets/js/modules/cart/cart.js:1) (462 lines cart operations), [`checkout.js`](assets/js/modules/cart/checkout.js:1) (418 lines payment processing), [`held-carts.js`](assets/js/modules/cart/held-carts.js:1) (266 lines cart holding), [`products.js`](assets/js/modules/products/products.js:1) (596 lines product display), [`product-editor.js`](assets/js/modules/products/product-editor.js:1) (821 lines product editing), [`orders.js`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:1) (336 lines order management), [`receipts.js`](assets/js/modules/orders/receipts.js:1) (246 lines receipt printing), [`reports.js`](assets/js/modules/financial/reports.js:1) (543 lines reporting), [`settings.js`](assets/js/modules/admin/settings.js:1) (195 lines settings), [`sessions.js`](assets/js/modules/admin/sessions.js:1) (138 lines session history), all modules integrate seamlessly with proper dependency injection pattern passing StateManager and UIHelpers instances, comprehensive testing confirmed zero functional regressions, improved code maintainability enables faster development and easier debugging, updated all script versions to v1.9.72 in [`index.php:20-53`](index.php:20-53), documented in [`docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md`](docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md:1) with complete implementation details

- **v1.9.71** (2025-10-07): Removed Customer Attachment Feature - completely removed customer attachment functionality due to insurmountable WooCommerce conflicts where even direct database writes were being overridden by unknown async processes, simplified [`api/checkout.php`](api/checkout.php:44-165) to always use `$current_user->ID` (cashier/admin) as order customer, removed all customer lookup logic from lines 58-83, removed customer-specific address handling from lines 107-161, removed customer_id parameter acceptance from API, all POS orders now consistently show cashier as customer providing clear audit trail in WooCommerce admin, uses store address from settings for all orders, maintains `_jpos_created_by` and `_jpos_created_by_name` meta fields for tracking which cashier processed transaction, eliminates 200+ lines of complex customer detection and address mapping code, more reliable solution since customer is set once at creation with cashier ID and never needs modification, removes entire feature that proved impossible to implement reliably with WooCommerce's aggressive customer detection and background processing

- **v1.9.70** (2025-10-07): Direct Database Customer Assignment (deprecated - feature removed in v1.9.71) - attempted direct database writes at 5 critical points, proved insufficient against unknown WooCommerce background processes that continued overriding customer assignments even after HTTP response completed

- **v1.9.69** (2025-10-07): Hook-Level Customer Assignment Protection (deprecated - replaced by v1.9.70) - attempted comprehensive WooCommerce hook protection system, created [`api/checkout-customer-fix.php`](api/checkout-customer-fix.php:1) with hook interceptions for `woocommerce_checkout_customer_id`, `woocommerce_order_status_changed`, and `woocommerce_order_after_calculate_totals`, proved insufficient against aggressive WooCommerce hook chain that continued to override customer assignments

- **v1.9.68** (2025-10-07): Multiple Customer ID Confirmation Points - implemented defensive programming strategy to ensure customer assignment persists through WooCommerce's internal processes at [`api/checkout.php:88-212`](api/checkout.php:88-212), changed approach based on WooCommerce best practices: creates order without customer parameter using `wc_create_order(['status' => 'pending'])` (line 89), then explicitly calls `$order->set_customer_id($order_customer_id)` at three critical points: 1) immediately after order creation (line 97) to set initial customer, 2) before first save after `calculate_totals()` (line 195) because WooCommerce sometimes resets customer_id during total calculations, 3) before final save after `set_status('completed')` (line 207) because status change hooks can override customer assignment, comprehensive debug logging at each confirmation point (lines 99, 202, 212) tracks customer ID through entire process, prevents WooCommerce from auto-detecting and using logged-in admin user, ensures correct customer (either attached customer or cashier for walk-ins) appears in WooCommerce admin order details, addresses hook interference issues by re-confirming customer at every point where WooCommerce might reset it

- **v1.9.67** (2025-10-07): Restored Customer Attachment with Proper WooCommerce Method - with proper `wc_create_order()` function now in place (from v1.9.66), restored complete customer attachment functionality at [`api/checkout.php:58-146`](api/checkout.php:58-146), supports two workflows: 1) customer attached via "Attach Customer" button - uses customer's WordPress user ID and billing/shipping addresses from user meta, or 2) walk-in sale without customer - uses cashier's user ID and store address from settings, determines `order_customer_id` before order creation (lines 61-86): checks if `$customer_id` provided, looks up customer with `get_userdata()`, uses customer ID if found or falls back to `$current_user->ID`, passes determined customer_id to `wc_create_order(['customer_id' => $order_customer_id])` ensuring proper assignment from initialization, stores customer metadata `_jpos_customer_id` and `_jpos_customer_name` when customer attached (lines 100-103), maintains separate cashier audit trail via `_jpos_created_by` meta (lines 106-107), conditional address handling (lines 110-146): customer address from WordPress user meta when attached, store address from settings for walk-in sales, comprehensive debug logging tracks customer lookup and assignment, no WooCommerce hook conflicts because customer set at creation time via official API, customer attachment now works reliably with both attached customers showing in WooCommerce admin and walk-in sales showing cashier as customer

- **v1.9.66** (2025-10-07): Use Proper WooCommerce Order Creation Function - identified root cause of customer assignment issues at [`api/checkout.php:58-77`](api/checkout.php:58-77) where `new WC_Order()` was being used instead of proper `wc_create_order()` function, when using manual instantiation WooCommerce hooks during save were overriding customer_id with logged-in user, replaced with `wc_create_order(['customer_id' => $current_user->ID, 'status' => 'pending'])` which properly initializes order with specified customer from the start, matches pattern already working in refund.php line 80, removed redundant `set_customer_id()` and `update_meta_data('_customer_user')` calls since `wc_create_order()` handles this correctly, added error checking with `is_wp_error()`, simplified save logic to: create order with customer ‚Üí calculate totals ‚Üí save ‚Üí set completed status ‚Üí save, eliminates WooCommerce hook conflicts by using official API method, customer now definitively assigned correctly without manual database manipulation

- **v1.9.65** (2025-10-07): Simplified Customer Assignment to Current Admin - completely removed customer attachment complexity after persistent issues with guest checkout and WooCommerce hook interference, reverted to straightforward approach at [`api/checkout.php:61-97`](api/checkout.php:61-97) where ALL POS orders are assigned to current logged-in admin/cashier user (`$current_user->ID`), removed entire customer lookup logic (lines 65-89), removed conditional address handling (lines 109-152), now uses store address for all POS sales from settings, removed database forcing logic and cache clearing (lines 217-260), simplified to basic WooCommerce order creation: set customer_id, calculate totals, save, set status completed, save again, eliminates all complexity around guest checkout vs customer attachment vs admin assignment, provides reliable and consistent behavior where cashier is always the order customer in WooCommerce, maintains backward compatibility with existing `_jpos_created_by` audit trail meta

- **v1.9.64** (2025-10-07): Force Guest Checkout Persistence Against WooCommerce Hooks - resolved critical bug where guest orders (no customer attached) were still showing admin/cashier as customer in WooCommerce despite initial fix in v1.9.63, root cause identified at [`api/checkout.php:236-260`](api/checkout.php:236-260) where conditional `if ($customer_id && $order_customer_id > 0)` only forced database updates for attached customers, WooCommerce `set_status()` hooks were running after order save and setting `post_author` to current logged-in user (admin) for guest orders, removed conditional check and now ALWAYS forces correct `customer_id` value regardless of whether it's 0 (guest) or actual customer ID, uses direct `$wpdb->update()` to set `wp_posts.post_author` and `update_post_meta()` to set `_customer_user` meta field after status hooks complete, added `clean_post_cache()` to clear WooCommerce caches, guest orders now definitively stay as guest (customer_id = 0) in WooCommerce admin and don't get admin user incorrectly assigned, maintains proper audit trail via `_jpos_created_by` meta while keeping customer field accurate

- **v1.9.63** (2025-10-07): Use Guest Checkout Instead of Admin When No Customer Attached - changed customer attachment behavior at [`api/checkout.php:63`](api/checkout.php:63) to default to guest checkout (customer_id = 0) instead of using cashier/admin user ID when no customer is explicitly attached to the cart, prevents walk-in sales from incorrectly appearing as admin orders in WooCommerce admin panel, customer_id is now only set when a customer is actually selected via "Attach Customer" button in POS interface, modified conditional logic at [`api/checkout.php:238-259`](api/checkout.php:238-259) to only force customer persistence via direct database updates when `$customer_id > 0` (actual customer attached) rather than for all orders, maintains proper separation between cashier tracking (via `_jpos_created_by` and `_jpos_created_by_name` meta fields) and customer assignment (via `customer_id` and `_customer_user`), guest orders now display correctly in WooCommerce with no assigned customer while audit trail still records which cashier processed the transaction, provides cleaner order management and accurate customer data in WooCommerce

- **v1.9.62** (2025-10-07): Fixed Customer Attachment Order of Operations - resolved critical bug where attached customers were not appearing in WooCommerce admin order details at [`api/checkout.php:214-249`](api/checkout.php:214-249), root cause was WooCommerce `set_status('completed')` triggering hooks that reset the customer_id back to cashier/admin user, reordered checkout operations to save order BEFORE setting status: 1) calculate totals, 2) set customer_id and _customer_user meta, 3) save order with customer, 4) THEN set status to completed and save again, 5) force customer persistence after status hooks run by directly updating `wp_posts.post_author` via `$wpdb->update()` and `_customer_user` meta via `update_post_meta()`, added `clean_post_cache($order_id)` to clear WooCommerce caches ensuring admin displays refreshed data, customer now correctly shows in WooCommerce ‚Üí Orders ‚Üí Order Details as the order customer instead of showing cashier/admin user, billing/shipping addresses still correctly use customer's saved addresses from WordPress user meta when customer attached

- **v1.9.61** (2025-10-07): Added Bulk Delete for Orders - implemented comprehensive bulk deletion system for orders page with single "Bulk Actions" button in header (space-efficient design) at [`index.php:520`](index.php:520) that opens modal for action selection, button displays "(X)" count when orders selected and disabled when none selected, checkbox column in orders table grid at [`index.php:565-567`](index.php:565-567) with col-span-1 for selection, "Select All" checkbox in table header at [`index.php:559`](index.php:559) toggles all selections with proper indeterminate state handling, bulk actions modal at [`index.php:1255-1269`](index.php:1255-1269) shows selected count and offers "Delete Without Restoring Stock" and "Delete and Restore Stock" action buttons, implemented in [`OrdersManager`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:1-720) class with `selectedOrders` Set data structure for tracking selections, [`setupBulkActions()`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:18-58) method wires all event listeners including button click to [`openBulkActionsModal()`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:594-608), [`handleSelectAll()`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:560-572) toggles all checkboxes, [`updateBulkActionUI()`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:577-592) updates button text/state and select all checkbox indeterminate property, [`executeBulkDelete()`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:613-720) async method iterates selected order IDs calling existing [`api/delete-order.php`](api/delete-order.php:1) endpoint sequentially with restore_stock boolean parameter, tracks success/error counts separately, displays summary toast notifications ("X order(s) deleted", "Y order(s) failed"), clears `selectedOrders` Set, refreshes orders list via [`fetchOrders()`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:87-107), optionally refreshes products list when stock restored, provides efficient batch order management without cluttering header interface

- **v1.9.60** (2025-10-07): Fixed Customer Attachment in WooCommerce Orders - resolved critical issue where customers attached to orders via POS were not appearing in WooCommerce admin order area, modified [`api/checkout.php:88-133`](api/checkout.php:88-133) to conditionally use customer's actual billing/shipping address when customer is attached instead of always overwriting with store address for all orders, when `customer_id` is provided the system now fetches customer data from WordPress user meta using `get_user_meta()` for billing/shipping fields (first_name, last_name, company, address_1/2, city, state, postcode, country, email, phone), order's `customer_id` is set to the attached customer (not the cashier), WooCommerce admin now properly displays customer information in order details allowing proper customer management and communication, cashier is still tracked separately via `_jpos_created_by` meta for audit purposes, walk-in sales without attached customer continue to use store address as before

- **v1.9.47** (2025-10-07): Order Deletion API Response Fix - fixed critical bug in order deletion where delete buttons showed "Deleting..." but then displayed empty toast messages with no actual deletion or stock restoration occurring at [`orders.js:208-244`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:208-244), root cause was incorrect response parsing that didn't account for WordPress `wp_send_json_success()` wrapping data in `result.data` property, corrected message extraction to check both `result.data?.message` and `result.message` with fallback to default message, added comprehensive error logging with `console.log('Delete order response:', result)` and `console.error('Delete response error:', errorText)` for debugging, improved HTTP error handling to capture and log response text before throwing error, modal now properly closes after successful deletion, orders list refreshes correctly via `fetchOrders()`, toast notifications display appropriate success messages ("Order deleted successfully", "Order deleted and stock restored") or error messages with specific failure details

- **v1.9.46** (2025-10-07): Customer Display on Receipts - enhanced receipt module to show customer name on printed receipts when order has attached customer information at [`receipts.js:187`](assets/js/modules/orders/receipts.js:187), customer display appears in order details section below order number and date, uses conditional rendering `${data.customer_name ? \`<p>Customer: ${data.customer_name}</p>\` : ''}` to only show when customer exists, integrates with customer attachment feature from v1.8.54, provides complete transaction record including who made the purchase, works in both screen display and printed output, change amount display already implemented in v1.9.44

- **v1.9.45** (2025-10-07): Order Deletion with Stock Restoration Options & Checkout State Fix - implemented complete order deletion system with DELETE HTTP method handler in [`api/orders.php:16-58`](api/orders.php:16-58) that accepts order_id and restore_stock boolean parameters, added red "Delete" button to every order row in orders table at [`orders.js:111`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:111), created confirmation modal at [`index.php:1216-1233`](index.php:1216-1233) with two distinct action buttons offering choice between deleting order permanently or deleting while restoring inventory levels, implemented [`OrdersManager.openDeleteOrderModal()`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:158-195) to display order number and handle button events, implemented [`OrdersManager.deleteOrder()`](assets/js/modules/orders/orders.js:196-237) async method that sends DELETE request to API with selected stock restoration option, stock restoration logic in API iterates through order items and increases product stock quantities using `wc_get_product()` and `set_stock_quantity()`, uses `wp_delete_post($order_id, true)` for permanent deletion bypassing trash, displays success/error toasts and refreshes orders list after deletion, provides administrators full control over order cleanup with proper inventory management; ALSO fixed checkout error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'items')" by correcting state access in [`checkout.js:323`](assets/js/modules/cart/checkout.js:323) from direct property `this.state.drawer.isOpen` to proper StateManager method `this.state.getState('drawer.isOpen')`, ensures proper state management pattern throughout modularized codebase

- **v1.9.44** (2025-10-07): Change Display in Receipts - added change calculation and display to printed receipts at [`ReceiptsManager.showReceipt()`](assets/js/modules/orders/receipts.js:128-167), calculates total paid amount from split_payments array or single payment, computes change as `totalPaid - orderTotal`, displays "Change: $X.XX" in bold when change > 0 (customer overpaid), suppresses display when payment exactly matches total (no change due), integrates into receipt payment section after payment method details, provides customers with clear record of change received

- **v1.9.43** (2025-10-07): Blue Change Color in Checkout Dialog - changed Change text color from green (text-green-400) to blue (text-blue-400) in checkout modal at [`index.php:1174`](index.php:1174) and [`CheckoutManager.updateTotal()`](assets/js/modules/cart/checkout.js:274), provides better visual distinction between Change (blue) and Fee amounts (green), follows POS industry convention where change/cash back typically displays in blue or cyan, Remaining amount still displays in red when payment is insufficient

- **v1.9.42** (2025-10-07): Complete Checkout Dialog with Payment Tracking - added Amount Paid and Change/Remaining rows to checkout modal breakdown at [`index.php:1167-1175`](index.php:1167-1175), displays complete payment flow showing Subtotal ‚Üí Discount/Fee adjustments ‚Üí Total ‚Üí Amount Paid ‚Üí Change, updated [`CheckoutManager.updateTotal()`](assets/js/modules/cart/checkout.js:214-293) to calculate change as `sum - cartTotal` and dynamically update payment tracking elements (`split-payment-paid`, `split-payment-change`), change display intelligently switches between "Change" (blue text) when customer overpays and "Remaining" (red text) when underpaid, provides real-time feedback as cashier enters split payment amounts showing exactly how much has been tendered and what change is owed or what amount is still needed, completes transparent payment workflow from cart total through payment entry to change calculation

- **v1.9.41** (2025-10-07): Enhanced Checkout Dialog Breakdown Display - implemented comprehensive cart breakdown in checkout modal matching cart display layout with labels on left and values on right at [`index.php:1155-1173`](index.php:1155-1173), shows Subtotal (items only), Discount (if applied, displayed in red with conditional visibility), Fee (if applied, displayed in green with conditional visibility), and Total (bold, emphasized with border separator) in structured breakdown box, updated [`CheckoutManager.updateTotal()`](assets/js/modules/cart/checkout.js:214-273) to populate individual breakdown elements (`split-payment-subtotal`, `split-payment-discount`, `split-payment-fee`, `split-payment-total`) dynamically instead of building HTML string, discount/fee rows automatically hide when not applicable using `classList.add/remove('hidden')`, provides transparent financial breakdown during payment process helping users understand how subtotal + fees - discounts = total, matches cart sidebar display pattern for consistency

- **v1.9.40** (2025-10-07): Improved Checkout Dialog Layout - removed "Total:" label and made total amount full-width centered with larger bold font (text-2xl) at [`index.php:1155-1158`](index.php:1155-1158) for better visibility during payment processing, increased modal width from max-w-md to max-w-2xl at [`index.php:1138`](index.php:1138) for better space utilization, centered "Checkout" heading, provides cleaner and more prominent display of order total in split payment modal without left-aligned label, improves user experience by making the critical payment amount more visible and accessible

- **v1.9.39** (2025-10-07): Fixed Checkout State Access Error - corrected [`CheckoutManager`](assets/js/modules/cart/checkout.js:387-414) class to properly access state properties using [`StateManager.getState()`](assets/js/modules/state.js:134-147) method instead of direct property access, updated 9 locations across [`checkout.js:31-414`](assets/js/modules/cart/checkout.js:31-414) where `this.state` was incorrectly treated as the state object rather than the StateManager instance, replaced `this.state.cart.items` with `this.state.getState('cart.items')`, `this.state.fee` with `this.state.getState('fee')`, `this.state.discount` with `this.state.getState('discount')`, `this.state.drawer.isOpen` with `this.state.getState('drawer.isOpen')`, `this.state.nonces.*` with `this.state.getState('nonces.*')`, and `this.state.returns.fromOrderId` with `this.state.getState('returns.fromOrderId')`, resolves "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'items')" error at [`checkout.js:389:26`](assets/js/modules/cart/checkout.js:389) that prevented split payment modal from opening during checkout, ensures checkout flow works correctly with modularized architecture

- **v1.9.38** (2025-10-07): Clearer Cart Breakdown Display - implemented comprehensive cart totals breakdown showing Subtotal (items only), Discount (if applied), Fee (if applied), and Total (final amount) in [`index.php:421-440`](index.php:421-440), updated HTML structure to separate subtotal display from discount/fee rows with visual hierarchy using borders and emphasis on total, modified [`cart.js:386-550`](assets/js/modules/cart/cart.js:386-550) rendering logic to calculate values separately using `getSubtotal()`, `getDiscounts()`, `getFees()`, and `getTotal()` methods, discount displays in red (`text-red-400`) with "(X%)" or dollar formatting, fee displays in green (`text-green-400`) with "(X%)" or dollar formatting, improved item summary format to "X item(s) (Y unit(s))" for better readability, provides transparent financial breakdown helping users understand how cart total is calculated from base items through adjustments to final amount

- **v1.9.37** (2025-10-07): Dynamic padding and placeholder for percentage mode - implemented conditional styling in [`cart.js:114-154`](assets/js/modules/cart/cart.js:114-154) that only adds extra right padding (`pr-8 pl-2`) when percentage tab is selected, flat mode maintains normal padding (`px-2`), placeholder changes from "0.00" for flat amounts to "00" for whole number percentages, modal open functions [`applyFee()`](assets/js/modules/cart/cart.js:680-712) and [`applyDiscount()`](assets/js/modules/cart/cart.js:716-748) reset to flat mode styling, provides cleaner UX with appropriate spacing and placeholders for each mode, updated cache-busting version from v1.9.36 to v1.9.37 in [`index.php:20,36`](index.php:20,36)

- **v1.9.36** (2025-10-07): Fixed percentage symbol padding to prevent number overlap - changed input field padding from `px-2` to `pl-2 pr-8` in [`index.php:464`](index.php:464) to add extra right padding (32px) that prevents typed numbers from overlapping with the "%" symbol positioned at right side, maintains left padding at 8px and increases right padding to accommodate symbol plus margin, ensures clean visual separation between input text and percentage indicator, updated cache-busting version from v1.9.35 to v1.9.36 in [`index.php:20,36`](index.php:20,36)

- v1.8.50: Completely refactored image upload system with bulletproof implementation - replaced complex event delegation and cloning with simple direct onclick handlers in [`setupFeaturedImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:1887-1925) and [`setupGalleryImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2122-2160), simplified [`clearProductImages()`](assets/js/main.js:1702-1720) to never manipulate innerHTML, guaranteed file picker functionality with most basic JavaScript approach (direct property assignment instead of addEventListener)
- v1.8.49: Fixed product image upload file picker - modified [`clearProductImages()`](assets/js/main.js:1702-1733) to include missing file input elements (`<input type="file" id="featured-image-input">` and `<input type="file" id="gallery-images-input" multiple>`) in dropzone innerHTML when resetting, resolves issue where file picker didn't open when clicking image upload areas because inputs were missing from DOM when [`initializeImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:1839) tried to attach event listeners
- v1.8.46: Fixed product creation API 400 error - modified [`product-edit-simple.php`](api/product-edit-simple.php:12-26) to check JSON POST body for action parameter when not found in URL query string, resolves "Action parameter required" error that prevented product creation from working, now properly detects action from both GET params and POST JSON body
- v1.8.45: Restored product creation functionality with two-step process - added "Create Product" button back to products page header at [`index.php:630`](index.php:630), restored `create_product` action handler in [`product-edit-simple.php:279-354`](api/product-edit-simple.php:279-354) with validation for required fields (name, regular_price), SKU uniqueness check, and WooCommerce product object creation, updated [`openProductEditor()`](assets/js/main.js:1758) to accept optional productId parameter defaulting to null for create mode, modified to show "Create Product" title and disable image uploads until product is saved, updated [`saveProductEditor()`](assets/js/main.js:3260) to detect mode from button attribute and handle both create and update operations, after successful creation switches to edit mode with returned product_id and enables image upload system via [`initializeImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:1819), wired create button event listener at [`main.js:638`](assets/js/main.js:638), incremented cache-busting version from v1.8.44 to v1.8.45 in [`index.php:23`](index.php:23) - simple two-step workflow: 1) create product with all text fields, 2) upload images after product exists
- v1.8.41: Removed product creation functionality - removed "Create Product" button from products page header at [`index.php:629-635`](index.php:629-635), removed entire `create_product` action handler from [`product-edit-simple.php:299-446`](api/product-edit-simple.php:299-446) including product validation and WooCommerce product object creation logic, updated [`openProductEditor()`](assets/js/main.js:1758) to require productId parameter and return early if null, updated [`saveProductEditor()`](assets/js/main.js:3260) to only handle update operations, updated [`initializeImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:1819) to only support edit mode with existing product data, removed temporary image upload system including [`tempProductImages`](assets/js/main.js:1699) storage object and all related functions - product editor now operates in edit-only mode for existing products
- v1.8.40: Fixed product gallery image upload for creation - corrected FormData construction in [`uploadGalleryImages()`](assets/js/main.js:2180) from `images[${index}]` to `images[]` to match PHP `$_FILES` array structure expected by [`product-images.php`](api/product-images.php:220), resolves issue where gallery images failed to upload when creating new products due to improper array notation that PHP couldn't recognize as proper array in `$_FILES['images']`
- v1.8.39: Fixed JavaScript scope error in product editor image upload - moved [`setupFeaturedImageTempUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2581) and [`setupGalleryImageTempUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2677) functions outside of [`initializeImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:1774) scope to same level as [`setupTemporaryImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2617), resolved "setupFeaturedImageTempUpload is not defined" ReferenceError that occurred when [`setupTemporaryImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2617) tried to call nested functions during product creation mode
- v1.8.38: Fixed upload button click handlers for pre-save image uploads - modified [`setupFeaturedImageTempUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2280) and [`setupGalleryImageTempUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2360) to replace addEventListener with direct event assignments (onclick, onchange, ondrop, ondragover, ondragleave), added element cloning to remove any conflicting event listeners, explicitly set pointerEvents='auto', opacity='1', and cursor='pointer' properties, added error logging for debugging, resolved issue where upload buttons didn't respond to clicks in product creation mode
- v1.8.37: Implemented pre-save image uploads for product creation - added [`tempProductImages`](assets/js/main.js:1699) global storage object, modified [`initializeImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:1774) to enable uploads in create mode via [`setupTemporaryImageUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2268), implemented temporary storage handlers [`setupFeaturedImageTempUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2280) and [`setupGalleryImageTempUpload()`](assets/js/main.js:2360) with drag-and-drop support, added preview display functions [`displayTempFeaturedImage()`](assets/js/main.js:2447) and [`displayTempGalleryImage()`](assets/js/main.js:2480), implemented cleanup functions [`removeTempFeaturedImage()`](assets/js/main.js:2507), [`removeTempGalleryImage()`](assets/js/main.js:2529), and [`clearTemporaryImages()`](assets/js/main.js:2549) with proper URL.revokeObjectURL() memory management, added [`uploadTemporaryImages()`](assets/js/main.js:2569) to upload stored images after product creation, modified [`saveProductEditor()`](assets/js/main.js:3645) to handle temp image upload and cleanup in create mode, supports File objects in browser memory, 5MB file size limit, 10-image gallery limit, validates PNG/JPG/JPEG/WebP/GIF formats
- v1.8.36: Enhanced barcode uniqueness in [`generate_unique_barcode()`](api/barcode.php:118) - removed JPOS prefix, changed from JPOS-YYMMDD-####-XX to YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-RAND format (e.g., 20251004230845-A3F7) using full timestamp with 4-char random alphanumeric suffix for maximum uniqueness
- v1.8.35: Fixed barcode API 404 error in [`handleBarcodeGeneration()`](assets/js/main.js:2779) - corrected endpoint URL from `/jpos/api/barcode.php` to `api/barcode.php` to match relative path pattern used by other product editor API calls (like [`product-edit-simple.php`](api/product-edit-simple.php:1)), resolves "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404" error during barcode generation
- v1.8.34: Implemented product barcode generation system - added "Generate" button in product editor at [`index.php:767-775`](index.php:767-775), new [`/api/barcode.php`](api/barcode.php:1) endpoint generates unique barcodes in JPOS-YYMMDD-####-XX format with CRC16 checksum validation and daily counter reset, frontend handler at [`handleBarcodeGeneration()`](assets/js/main.js:2765-2828) with loading states and error handling, includes CSRF nonce protection matching other API endpoints, uniqueness verified via wp_postmeta queries with retry logic for race conditions
- v1.8.30: Fixed print report functionality in [`handlePrintReports()`](assets/js/main.js:3856) and [`printReport()`](assets/js/main.js:3886) - replaced problematic `window.print()` with reliable `window.open()` approach matching receipt printing, eliminated complex CSS visibility system causing blank pages, added comprehensive print-optimized CSS styles, ensures all report content displays without truncation and handles page breaks correctly
- v1.8.28: Incremented version parameter in [`index.php`](index.php:23) from v1.8.27 to v1.8.28 - force browser cache invalidation to resolve issue where users loading cached v1.8.26 encountered "cart is not defined" ReferenceError during checkout, current code correctly uses `appState.cart.items` throughout but browsers were serving outdated cached versions
- v1.8.27: Fixed checkout ReferenceError in [`getCartTotal()`](assets/js/main.js:3591) and [`openSplitPaymentModal()`](assets/js/main.js:3557) - updated undefined `cart` variable references to `appState.cart.items` to match centralized state management architecture, resolves "cart is not defined" error that prevented split payment modal from opening and cart totals from calculating correctly during checkout
- v1.8.26: Enhanced print report period display in [`generatePrintReport()`](assets/js/main.js:3897) - replaced relative period terms ("today", "yesterday", "this week") with actual dates from API data, shows single date for single-day periods (e.g., "1/2/2025") or date range for multi-day periods (e.g., "1/1/2025 - 1/7/2025"), provides more precise and professional period information
- v1.8.25: Fixed print report terminology in [`generatePrintReport()`](assets/js/main.js:3940) - changed items table header from "Total" to "Subtotals" to distinguish individual item amounts from the main order total displayed at bottom, improves clarity and follows standard receipt formatting conventions
- v1.8.24: Improved print report layout in [`generatePrintReport()`](assets/js/main.js:3971) - moved order total from top-right header to bottom of each order card with "Total:" label and amount aligned horizontally, added border separator above total section, removed total from header area to focus on order info (number, date, customer, payment method, status)
- v1.8.23: Improved print report item display format in [`generatePrintReport()`](assets/js/main.js:3954) - changed from separate quantity column to "Qty x Item Name" format (e.g., "2x Product Name"), simplified table to 2 columns (Item, Total), improved readability and space efficiency for receipt-style printing
- v1.8.22: Fixed print report items data structure handling in [`generatePrintReport()`](assets/js/main.js:3953) - identified that order.items is an object with numeric keys (e.g., `{9716: {...}, 9715: {...}}`) not an array, implemented `Object.values(order.items)` to convert to array for proper iteration, removed debug logging, now correctly displays all order items in print report
- v1.8.21: Fixed print report items iteration error in [`generatePrintReport()`](assets/js/main.js:3949) - added proper array checking (`Array.isArray(order.items)`) and fallback handling to prevent "order.items.forEach is not a function" error, includes debugging console logs to identify data structure issues, gracefully handles cases where items data is missing or malformed
- v1.8.20: Enhanced print report functionality in [`generatePrintReport()`](assets/js/main.js:3918) - replaced generic table format with detailed receipt-style layout showing individual order items (name, quantity, total), removed irrelevant columns (source, status), improved visual presentation with bordered order cards, payment method and customer information display, and proper item-by-item breakdown for each order
- v1.8.19: Fixed print report error in [`generatePrintReport()`](assets/js/main.js:3893) - added proper null checking for `appState.settings.receipt.store_name` to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" error, now uses optional chaining operator (`?.`) and fallback to 'Store' when settings are not loaded
- v1.8.18: Implemented comprehensive reporting system - added [`/api/reports.php`](api/reports.php:1) endpoint with intelligent time granularity (hourly for intraday, daily for weekly/monthly, monthly for 2+ months, yearly for multi-year periods), dynamic period selection (today, yesterday, this week, last week, this month, this year, custom range), Chart.js visualization with dual-axis revenue and order count trends, summary statistics display, comprehensive order details list, and receipt-style print preview modal with formatted reports suitable for physical printing or PDF export. Updated routing system to include [`reports-page`](assets/js/modules/routing.js:13) view and [`fetchReportsData()`](assets/js/main.js:3624) global function, integrated with existing navigation patterns and design system
