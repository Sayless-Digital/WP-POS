# Agent Operating Instructions

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST üö®

### MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION UPDATE PROTOCOL

**EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A CODE CHANGE, YOU MUST UPDATE ALL THREE DOCUMENTATION FILES:**

1. ‚úÖ **agents.md** (this file) - System version at line 1792 and version history at line 2327
2. ‚úÖ **docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** - Technical documentation with API details and troubleshooting
3. ‚úÖ **docs/USER_MANUAL.md** - User-facing documentation (if change affects users)

**NO EXCEPTIONS. This is not optional.**

### MANDATORY VERSION NUMBER UPDATE PROTOCOL

**EVERY TIME YOU MODIFY CLIENT-SIDE FILES (main.js, routing.js, etc.), YOU MUST:**

1. ‚úÖ Update version parameter in **index.php** (lines 21-23)
2. ‚úÖ Update system version in **agents.md** (line 1792)
3. ‚úÖ Update "Latest Update" in **agents.md** (line 1794)
4. ‚úÖ Add version history entry in **agents.md** (line 2327)

**Failing to update versions causes browser caching issues where users get old code even after updates.**

### CONSEQUENCES OF SKIPPING THESE STEPS

- ‚ùå **Documentation gaps** - Future developers can't understand system changes
- ‚ùå **Browser caching issues** - Users stuck with old, broken code
- ‚ùå **Lost tracking** - No record of what was changed or why
- ‚ùå **Production failures** - Features don't work because of cached old code

### QUICK CHECKLIST

Before marking ANY task complete, verify:

- [ ] Updated agents.md with version entry and feature summary
- [ ] Updated docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md with technical details
- [ ] Updated docs/USER_MANUAL.md if user-facing change
- [ ] Updated version numbers in index.php if JavaScript/CSS changed
- [ ] Incremented system version in agents.md
- [ ] Added version history entry to agents.md

**If you can't check ALL boxes above, the task is NOT complete.**

### Cross-Referencing Protocol

#### üö® CRITICAL: When Documenting Code Changes

**YOU MUST UPDATE ALL THREE DOCUMENTATION FILES:**

1. ‚úÖ **Update agents.md**: Add to version history (line 2327), update feature summary, update system version (line 1792)
2. ‚úÖ **Update docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md**: Add technical details, API changes, troubleshooting
3. ‚úÖ **Update docs/USER_MANUAL.md** (if user-facing): Add usage instructions, screenshots needs

**This is MANDATORY, not optional. All three files must be kept in sync.**

#### Example Cross-Reference Flow
```markdown
<!-- In agents.md -->
- v1.8.18: Implemented product search optimization with fuzzy matching

<!-- In DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md -->
### Product Search API
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm for typo tolerance
- See [Product Management](docs/USER_MANUAL.md#product-management) for user guide

<!-- In USER_MANUAL.md -->
### Searching Products
- Type product names even with typos - the system automatically corrects them
- Technical details in [API Reference](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#product-endpoints)
```

## Real-Time Documentation Protocols

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Real-Time Documentation Mandate

**YOU MUST DOCUMENT CHANGES AS YOU MAKE THEM, NOT AFTER THE FACT.**

**UPDATE ALL THREE DOCUMENTATION FILES (agents.md, docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, docs/USER_MANUAL.md)**

This means:
- Document **between each discrete change** to the codebase
- Update documentation **before marking a step complete**
- Maintain documentation **during multi-step changes**, not at the end
- Update relevant documentation **immediately after confirming successful tool execution**
- **UPDATE VERSION NUMBERS** in index.php (lines 21-23) if JavaScript/CSS files changed
- **UPDATE SYSTEM VERSION** in agents.md (line 1792) after every change

### What Constitutes a "Change" Requiring Documentation

Every single instance of these actions requires immediate documentation:

1. **File Creation**: New files in [`api/`](api/), [`assets/js/`](assets/js/), [`config/`](config/), [`tests/`](tests/), or root directory
2. **Function Addition**: New functions, methods, or classes
3. **Function Modification**: Changes to function parameters, logic, or return values
4. **API Endpoint Changes**: New endpoints, modified parameters, or changed response formats
5. **Configuration Updates**: Changes to [`config/wp-pos-config.json`](config/wp-pos-config.json:1)
6. **Bug Fixes**: Any correction to existing functionality
7. **Performance Optimizations**: Caching, query optimization, or bundle improvements
8. **Security Changes**: Authentication, validation, or CSRF protection updates
9. **UI Modifications**: Layout, styling, or interaction changes
10. **Database Schema Changes**: New tables, fields, or relationships

### Documentation Workflow

#### Step-by-Step Process

**INCORRECT Approach (Do NOT Do This):**
```
1. Make 5 file changes
2. Test everything
3. Document all changes at once
4. Mark task complete
```

**CORRECT Approach (Always Do This):**
```
1. Make first file change (e.g., create api/new-endpoint.php)
2. ‚úÖ Confirm tool execution succeeded
3. üìù DOCUMENT: Update agents.md version history (line 2327)
4. üìù DOCUMENT: Update agents.md system version (line 1792)
5. üìù DOCUMENT: Add to docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md API Reference
6. üìù DOCUMENT: Update docs/USER_MANUAL.md if user-facing

7. Make second file change (e.g., update assets/js/main.js)
8. ‚úÖ Confirm tool execution succeeded
9. üìù UPDATE VERSION: Increment version in index.php (lines 21-23)
10. üìù DOCUMENT: Update agents.md feature summary
11. üìù DOCUMENT: Add troubleshooting notes to DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md if applicable

12. Continue pattern for each change...
```

#### Autonomous Work Sessions

During autonomous multi-step work, you must:

1. **Pause after each logical unit**: After creating a file, modifying a function, or fixing a bug
2. **Document immediately**: Update all relevant documentation files
3. **Verify documentation**: Ensure cross-references are correct
4. **Continue to next unit**: Only proceed after documentation is complete

**Example Autonomous Session:**
```
Task: "Add product export functionality"

Step 1: Create api/export-products.php
- Wait for confirmation: "File created successfully"
- Update agents.md: Line in File Structure, new API endpoint, version history (line 2327)
- Update agents.md: System version (line 1792)
- Update docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Add to API Reference with examples
- Update docs/USER_MANUAL.md: Add to Product Management section

Step 2: Add export button to products page
- Wait for confirmation: "File modified successfully"
- Update version in index.php (line 23) if JavaScript changed
- Update agents.md: Add to Features section
- Update docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Add UI interaction notes
- Update docs/USER_MANUAL.md: Add step-by-step export instructions

Step 3: Test export functionality
- Execute test command
- Wait for confirmation: "Test passed"
- Update agents.md: Add to Testing section
- Document any edge cases found in docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
```

### Documentation Checkpoints

Before proceeding to the next change, verify:

- [ ] All affected documentation files identified

## Concrete Examples

### Example 1: Feature Implementation with Proper Documentation

**Scenario:** Adding a product search autocomplete feature

#### Step 1: Implement Backend API
```bash
# Create new API endpoint
write_to_file api/product-autocomplete.php
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`agents.md`](agents.md:1):
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Implemented product search autocomplete with real-time suggestions
```

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
#### GET /api/product-autocomplete.php

Returns product suggestions based on partial search input.

**Query Parameters:**
- `query`: (required) Search term (minimum 2 characters)
- `limit`: (optional) Maximum suggestions to return, default: 10

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "suggestions": [
            {"id": 123, "name": "Product Name", "sku": "SKU123"},
            {"id": 124, "name": "Another Product", "sku": "SKU124"}
        ],
        "count": 2
    }
}
```
```

#### Step 2: Implement Frontend Component
```bash
# Modify main JavaScript
apply_diff assets/js/main.js
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Product Search Autocomplete

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Implemented in [`main.js`](../assets/js/main.js:567)
async function handleSearchAutocomplete(query) {
    if (query.length < 2) return [];
    
    const response = await fetch(`/api/product-autocomplete.php?query=${query}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    return data.success ? data.data.suggestions : [];
}
```

**Usage:** Type at least 2 characters in product search to see suggestions
```

Update [`USER_MANUAL.md`](docs/USER_MANUAL.md:1):
```markdown
### Product Search Autocomplete (New in v1.8.18)

As you type in the product search box, you'll see real-time suggestions:

1. Type at least 2 characters in the search box
2. Suggestions appear automatically below the search input
3. Click any suggestion to select that product
4. Press ESC to close suggestions without selecting

**Note:** Suggestions are based on product names and SKUs.
```

#### Step 3: Test Implementation
```bash
# Run tests
execute_command php tests/php/test-autocomplete.php
```

**After Test Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Testing Product Autocomplete

```bash
php tests/php/test-autocomplete.php
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Empty query handling
- Single character rejection
- Valid query suggestions
- Result limit enforcement
- Special character handling
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix with Incremental Documentation

**Scenario:** Fixing cart total calculation error

#### Step 1: Identify and Document Problem
**Before Fixing:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1) Troubleshooting:
```markdown
#### Cart Total Calculation Error (v1.8.18)
- **Problem**: Cart displays incorrect total when discount codes are applied
- **Symptoms**: Total shows higher amount than expected, ignores percentage discounts
- **Root Cause**: INVESTIGATING...
```

#### Step 2: Fix the Code
```bash
# Fix the calculation function
apply_diff assets/js/modules/cart.js
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
#### Cart Total Calculation Error (v1.8.18)
- **Problem**: Cart displays incorrect total when discount codes are applied
- **Symptoms**: Total shows higher amount than expected, ignores percentage discounts
- **Root Cause**: Discount percentage was being added instead of subtracted in [`calculateCartTotal()`](../assets/js/modules/cart.js:234)
- **Solution**: Fixed line 234 from `total += discount` to `total -= discount`
- **Prevention**: Added unit tests for discount calculations in [`test-cart.js`](../tests/js/test-cart.js:1)

**Before:**
```javascript
function calculateCartTotal() {
    let total = subtotal;
    if (discount > 0) total += discount; // BUG: Should subtract
    return total;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function calculateCartTotal() {
    let total = subtotal;
    if (discount > 0) total -= discount; // FIXED: Now correctly subtracts
    return total;
}
```
```

Update [`agents.md`](agents.md:1):
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Fixed cart total calculation bug - discount percentages now correctly subtracted instead of added
```

#### Step 3: Add Test
```bash
# Create test for the fix
write_to_file tests/js/test-cart-discount.js
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Testing Cart Calculations

```bash
# Run cart tests
node tests/js/test-runner.js test-cart-discount.js
```

**Test Cases:**
- Percentage discount: 10% off $100 = $90
- Fixed amount discount: $10 off $100 = $90
- Multiple discounts: Correctly applies both
- Edge case: 100% discount = $0
```

### Example 3: Configuration Change Documentation

**Scenario:** Adding new cache configuration option

#### Step 1: Update Configuration File
```bash
# Modify config
apply_diff config/wp-pos-config.json
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`agents.md`](agents.md:1):
```markdown
- v1.8.19: Fixed things
- v1.8.20: Made improvements
```

**Why Wrong:** No actionable information, no searchability, no learning value

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Descriptive Version History
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Implemented product search autocomplete - real-time suggestions appear after typing 2+ characters, using new [`/api/product-autocomplete.php`](api/product-autocomplete.php:1) endpoint
- v1.8.19: Fixed cart total calculation in [`calculateCartTotal()`](assets/js/modules/cart.js:234) - discount percentages now correctly subtracted (was adding), added unit tests
- v1.8.20: Added `cache.cleanup_on_startup` boolean to [`wp-pos-config.json`](config/wp-pos-config.json:1) - controls automatic cache cleanup at application start, defaults to true
```

#### ‚ùå WRONG: No Cross-References
```markdown
### New Feature

Added product export functionality. It's in the API somewhere and there's a button for it.
```

**Why Wrong:** No file references, no line numbers, impossible to locate in codebase

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Complete Cross-References
```markdown
### Product Export (v1.8.18)

**Implementation:**
- API Endpoint: [`/api/export-products.php`](api/export-products.php:1)
- Frontend Handler: [`handleProductExport()`](assets/js/main.js:789)
- UI Button: Added to products page at [`index.php`](index.php:456) line 456
- Configuration: Uses `export.format` from [`wp-pos-config.json`](config/wp-pos-config.json:23)

**Related Documentation:**
- Technical details: [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md - Export API](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#export-api)
- User guide: [USER_MANUAL.md - Exporting Products](docs/USER_MANUAL.md#exporting-products)
```

## Version Management & Cache Busting Protocol

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Version Updates are MANDATORY

**YOU MUST UPDATE VERSION NUMBERS AFTER EVERY CHANGE THAT AFFECTS CLIENT-SIDE FILES.**

Failing to update versions will cause:
- ‚ùå Users seeing cached old code even after updates
- ‚ùå JavaScript errors from mismatched file versions
- ‚ùå Features not working in production
- ‚ùå Cache-related bugs that are extremely difficult to debug

**This is NOT optional. Version updates are as important as the code changes themselves.**

---

### Current Versioning System

WP POS uses **query parameter versioning** for cache busting:

**How It Works:**
```html
<!-- Version parameters force browser to download new files -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.10"></script>
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Browsers cache JavaScript files aggressively
- Without version changes, users get old cached code
- Version parameter change = browser treats it as a new file
- Forces fresh download = users always get latest code

**Current Versions (as of latest update):**
- System Version: `v1.8.26` (in [`agents.md`](agents.md:1792))
- Main JavaScript: `v1.8.26` (in [`index.php`](index.php:23))
- Routing Module: `v1.5.11` (in [`index.php`](index.php:21))

---

### When to Update Versions

#### Major Version (X.0.0) - Breaking Changes
**Update when:**
- Complete system rewrites or major architecture changes
- Breaking API changes that affect all consumers
- Removal of deprecated features that break existing functionality
- Database schema changes requiring migrations
- Changes to core authentication or security systems

**Examples:**
- `1.8.17` ‚Üí `2.0.0`: Complete rewrite from jQuery to vanilla JavaScript
- `2.0.0` ‚Üí `3.0.0`: Migration from REST API to GraphQL

**Impact:** Requires user action, may need data migration, extensive testing needed

---

#### Minor Version (0.X.0) - New Features
**Update when:**
- Adding new features or significant enhancements
- New API endpoints or major functionality additions
- UI/UX improvements that change user workflows
- Performance optimizations with measurable impact
- New configuration options or settings

**Examples:**
- `1.8.17` ‚Üí `1.9.0`: Added comprehensive reporting system with charts
- `1.6.5` ‚Üí `1.7.0`: Implemented product search autocomplete

**Impact:** Backward compatible, enhances functionality, no breaking changes

---

#### Patch Version (0.0.X) - Bug Fixes & Minor Updates
**Update when:**
- Bug fixes that don't change functionality
- Minor styling or layout adjustments
- Performance tweaks without major impact
- Documentation updates (code comments, inline docs)
- Dependency updates that don't change behavior
- Security patches

**Examples:**
- `1.8.17` ‚Üí `1.8.18`: Fixed cart total calculation bug
- `1.8.18` ‚Üí `1.8.19`: Updated button styling for consistency

**Impact:** Backward compatible, fixes issues, minimal risk

---

### How to Update Versions

#### Step 1: Determine Version Increment Type

**Ask yourself:**
- Does this break existing functionality? ‚Üí **Major**
- Does this add new features? ‚Üí **Minor**
- Does this fix bugs or make minor changes? ‚Üí **Patch**

#### Step 2: Update Version in index.php

**Location:** [`index.php`](index.php:21-23)

**For JavaScript file changes:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>

<!-- AFTER (for patch) -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.18"></script>
```

**For routing module changes:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.10"></script>

<!-- AFTER (for patch) -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.11"></script>
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**
- Update ONLY the file(s) you modified
- If you change `main.js`, update `main.js` version
- If you change `routing.js`, update `routing.js` version
- If you change both, update both versions

#### Step 3: Update System Version in agents.md

**Location:** [`agents.md`](agents.md:1290) (System Overview section)

**Update the "Current System Status" section:**
```markdown
<!-- BEFORE -->
**Version**: 1.8.18

<!-- AFTER -->
**Version**: 1.8.19
```

**Update the "Latest Update" line:**
```markdown
<!-- BEFORE -->
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.8.18 - [previous feature description]

<!-- AFTER -->
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.8.19 - [your new feature/fix description]
```

#### Step 4: Add Version History Entry

**Location:** [`agents.md`](agents.md:1823) (bottom of file)

**Add new line to Version History section:**
```markdown
## Version History

- v1.8.19: [Brief description] - [technical details with file links]
- v1.8.18: Implemented comprehensive reporting system - added [`/api/reports.php`]...
```

**Format:**
```markdown
- v1.X.X: [What changed] - [Why/How with file references]
```

#### Step 5: Update DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (If Applicable)

**Location:** [`docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1)

**Add version reference in relevant section:**
```markdown
### Feature Name (v1.8.19)
[Feature documentation with version number]
```

### Cache Busting Mechanism Explained

#### How Browser Caching Works
```
User visits site
    ‚Üì
Browser checks: "Do I have main.js?v=1.8.17 cached?"
    ‚Üì
YES ‚Üí Use cached version (FAST but may be outdated)
NO  ‚Üí Download from server (SLOW but always current)
```

#### How Version Changes Force Updates
```
You deploy: main.js?v=1.8.18 (version changed)
    ‚Üì
User visits site
    ‚Üì
Browser checks: "Do I have main.js?v=1.8.18 cached?"
    ‚Üì
NO (because v1.8.18 is NEW) ‚Üí Downloads fresh version
    ‚Üì
User gets latest code! ‚úÖ
```

#### What Happens Without Version Updates
```
You deploy: main.js (code updated, but version still v1.8.17)
    ‚Üì
User visits site
    ‚Üì
Browser checks: "Do I have main.js?v=1.8.17 cached?"
    ‚Üì
YES (same version!) ‚Üí Uses OLD cached code
    ‚Üì
User gets outdated code! ‚ùå
Result: New features don't work, bugs aren't fixed
```

- [ ] Documentation references correct version numbers

---

### Examples

#### Example 1: Bug Fix (Patch Version)

**Scenario:** Fixed cart total calculation error

**Version Update:**
```html
<!-- index.php line 23 -->
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>

<!-- AFTER -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.18"></script>
```

**agents.md System Overview (line 1290):**
```markdown
**Version**: 1.8.18
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.8.18 - Fixed cart total calculation bug where discount percentages were added instead of subtracted
```

**agents.md Version History (line 1823):**
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Fixed cart total calculation in [`calculateCartTotal()`](assets/js/modules/cart.js:234) - discount percentages now correctly subtracted (was adding), added unit tests
```

---

#### Example 2: New Feature (Minor Version)

**Scenario:** Added product search autocomplete

**Version Update:**
```html
<!-- index.php line 23 -->
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>

<!-- AFTER -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.9.0"></script>
```

**agents.md System Overview (line 1290):**
```markdown
**Version**: 1.9.0
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.9.0 - Implemented product search autocomplete with real-time suggestions appearing after 2+ characters
```

**agents.md Version History (line 1823):**
```markdown
- v1.9.0: Implemented product search autocomplete - real-time suggestions appear after typing 2+ characters, using new [`/api/product-autocomplete.php`](api/product-autocomplete.php:1) endpoint with [`handleSearchAutocomplete()`](assets/js/main.js:567) frontend handler
```

---

#### Example 3: Multiple File Changes

**Scenario:** Updated both main.js and routing.js

**Version Update:**
```html
<!-- index.php lines 21-23 -->
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.10"></script>
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>

<!-- AFTER -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.11"></script>
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.18"></script>
```

**agents.md Update:**
```markdown
**Version**: 1.8.18
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.8.18 - Enhanced routing system with improved error handling and updated main navigation logic

## Version History
- v1.8.18: Enhanced routing system - improved error handling in [`routing.js`](assets/js/modules/routing.js:1) and updated navigation logic in [`main.js`](assets/js/main.js:1)
```

---

#### Example 4: Version Number in URLs

**How versions appear in browser:**
```
https://example.com/wp-pos/assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.18
                                                  ‚Üë
                                        Cache busting parameter
```

**Browser treats these as DIFFERENT files:**
- `main.js?v=1.8.17` ‚Üê Old version (cached)
- `main.js?v=1.8.18` ‚Üê New version (forces download)

---

### Integration with Existing Documentation Protocols

#### During Real-Time Documentation (Section 3)

**Add version update as a documentation step:**
```
1. Make code change to main.js
2. ‚úÖ Confirm tool execution succeeded
3. üìù UPDATE VERSION: Increment main.js version in index.php
4. üìù DOCUMENT: Update agents.md version history
5. üìù DOCUMENT: Add to DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md with version reference
```

#### In Documentation Templates (Section 4)

**Update "New Feature" template to include:**
```markdown
**agents.md Entry:**
- v1.X.X: [Feature name] - [Description] with file links
- **Files Changed**: [`file.js`](path/file.js:1) (v1.X.X)
- **Version Update**: Updated from v1.X.X to v1.X.X in [`index.php`](index.php:23)
```

#### In Interconnected Changes (Section 7)

**Add to Phase 6: Final Documentation Pass:**
```markdown
#### Phase 6: Version Update & Final Documentation
- [ ] Version numbers updated in index.php
- [ ] System version updated in agents.md
- [ ] Version history entry added
- [ ] All version references consistent
- [ ] [Continue with existing cross-reference checks...]
```

---

### Common Version Update Mistakes

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 1: Not updating version at all
```html
<!-- You changed main.js but didn't update version -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script>
```
**Result:** Users get cached old code, new features don't work

---

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 2: Wrong version increment
```html
<!-- Bug fix but incremented major version -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=2.0.0"></script>
```
**Result:** Confusing version history, breaks semantic versioning

---

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 3: Updating wrong file version
```html
<!-- You changed main.js but updated routing.js version -->
<script src="assets/js/modules/routing.js?v=1.5.11"></script>
<script src="assets/js/main.js?v=1.8.17"></script> <!-- Should be 1.8.18! -->
```
**Result:** Browser doesn't re-download the changed file

---

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 4: Inconsistent version numbers
```markdown
<!-- index.php says v1.8.18 but agents.md says v1.8.19 -->
```
**Result:** Documentation doesn't match deployed version

---

#### ‚ùå MISTAKE 5: Skipping version history entry
```markdown
<!-- Updated version in index.php but no history entry in agents.md -->
```
**Result:** No record of what changed, impossible to track features

---

### Version Update Quick Reference

| Change Type | Example | Version Change | Update Files |
|-------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Bug Fix** | Fixed calculation error | 1.8.17 ‚Üí 1.8.18 | index.php, agents.md |
| **New Feature** | Added autocomplete | 1.8.17 ‚Üí 1.9.0 | index.php, agents.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md |
| **Breaking Change** | Complete rewrite | 1.8.17 ‚Üí 2.0.0 | index.php, agents.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, USER_MANUAL.md |
| **Minor Update** | Updated styling | 1.8.17 ‚Üí 1.8.18 | index.php, agents.md |
| **Module Change** | Fixed routing bug | routing: 1.5.10 ‚Üí 1.5.11 | index.php, agents.md |

---

### Testing Version Updates

#### Manual Verification

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check Network tab** in DevTools
4. **Verify** new version parameter in requests:
   ```
   Request URL: .../main.js?v=1.8.18
   Status: 200 (from server, not cache)
   ```

#### Automated Testing

Add version verification to your test suite:
```javascript
// Check that version was updated
test('Version updated after changes', () => {
    const scriptTag = document.querySelector('script[src*="main.js"]');
    const version = scriptTag.src.match(/v=(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)/)[1];
    
    // Verify version is greater than previous
    assert(version === '1.8.18', 'Version should be updated');
});
```

---

### Emergency Version Rollback

**If you need to rollback to a previous version:**

1. **Revert code changes** to previous version
2. **DO NOT revert version number** - increment forward instead
3. **Document the rollback:**
   ```markdown
   - v1.8.19: Rolled back autocomplete feature from v1.8.18 due to performance issues
   ```
4. **Add explanation** in DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md troubleshooting section

**Why not revert version numbers?**
- Users may have cached the "bad" version
- Going backward (1.8.18 ‚Üí 1.8.17) won't force cache refresh
- Always increment forward (1.8.18 ‚Üí 1.8.19) to ensure fresh download

---

### Summary: Version Management Rules

1. **Always update versions** when changing client-side code
2. **Update immediately** after confirming code change success
3. **Be consistent** across index.php and documentation
4. **Follow semantic versioning** (major.minor.patch)
5. **Document the change** in version history
6. **Test cache busting** works after update
7. **Never skip versions** - increment sequentially
8. **Never revert versions** - always move forward

**Remember: Version updates are not optional. They are critical for production deployments.**

## Interconnected Changes Protocol

### Understanding Interconnected Changes

Many changes in this codebase affect multiple components. When making interconnected changes, you must maintain consistency across all affected files and documentation.

#### Common Interconnection Patterns

1. **API + Frontend + Documentation**
   - API endpoint change ‚Üí Frontend consuming code ‚Üí User documentation
   - Example: Changing product API response format

2. **Configuration + Implementation + Documentation**
   - Config file ‚Üí Code reading config ‚Üí Developer guide ‚Üí User manual
   - Example: Adding new cache setting

3. **Database + API + Frontend**
   - Schema change ‚Üí API query ‚Üí Frontend display
   - Example: Adding new product field

4. **State Management + Components**
   - appState structure ‚Üí Multiple components using state
   - Example: Adding new cart property

### Protocol for Interconnected Changes

#### Step 1: Identify All Affected Components

Before making ANY change, list all affected components:

**Example: Adding product "favorite" functionality**
```
Affected Components:
- Database: wp_postmeta (new meta field)
- API: api/products.php (return favorite status)
- Frontend: assets/js/modules/products.js (display star icon)
- State: assets/js/modules/state.js (track favorites)
- UI: index.php (favorite button)
- Config: config/wp-pos-config.json (favorite settings)
- Docs: All three documentation files
```

#### Step 2: Plan Change Sequence

Order changes to maintain system functionality:

```
1. Database/Backend first (foundation)
2. API layer (interface)
3. Frontend/State (consumption)
4. UI (presentation)
5. Documentation (explanation)
```

#### Step 3: Implement with Incremental Documentation

For each component change:
1. Make the change
2. Confirm success
3. Document immediately (all relevant docs)
4. Verify related components still compatible
5. Move to next component

#### Step 4: Cross-Reference Updates

After all changes complete, verify all cross-references:

**Checklist:**
- [ ] agents.md updated with version entry
- [ ] agents.md features list updated
- [ ] agents.md file structure updated (if new files)
- [ ] DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md API section updated (if API changed)
- [ ] DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md architecture updated (if structure changed)
- [ ] DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md troubleshooting added (for new issues)
- [ ] USER_MANUAL.md usage instructions added (if user-facing)
- [ ] USER_MANUAL.md troubleshooting updated (for user issues)
- [ ] All code files have proper comments referencing docs
- [ ] All docs have proper markdown links to code files

### Example: Complete Interconnected Change

**Task:** Add product rating system

#### Phase 1: Database Layer
```bash
# Modify database schema

  ```markdown
  **Response includes new field:**
  ```json
  {
      "rating": 4.5,
      "rating_count": 28
  }
  ```
  ```

#### Phase 3: State Management
```bash
# Add rating to appState
apply_diff assets/js/modules/state.js
```

**Document Immediately:**
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Update State Management section
  ```markdown
  ### appState Structure
  ```javascript
  appState.products = {
      all: [],
      current: null,
      rating: null  // NEW: Current product rating
  };
  ```
  ```

#### Phase 4: Frontend Display
```bash
# Add star rating display

```

**Document Immediately:**
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Add UI implementation notes
- USER_MANUAL.md: Add to Product Information section

#### Phase 5: Configuration
```bash
# Add rating settings
apply_diff config/wp-pos-config.json
```

**Document Immediately:**
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Add configuration documentation
- agents.md: Update configuration summary

#### Phase 6: Final Documentation Pass

**Verify all cross-references:**
```markdown
<!-- agents.md -->
- v1.9.0: Implemented product rating system with 5-star display, average calculation, and user review counting

<!-- DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md -->
### Product Rating System (v1.9.0)
- API returns rating data in [`/api/products.php`](../api/products.php:1)
- State managed in [`appState.products.rating`](../assets/js/modules/state.js:45)
- Display handled by [`renderProductRating()`](../assets/js/modules/products.js:234)
- Configuration in [`config/wp-pos-config.json`](../config/wp-pos-config.json:67)

<!-- USER_MANUAL.md -->
### Product Ratings (New in v1.9.0)
Each product displays its average rating based on customer reviews:
1. Look for the star rating below the product name
2. See the number of reviews in parentheses
3. Click the rating to see detailed reviews
For technical implementation, see [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#product-rating-system)
```

# WP POS (WordPress Point of Sale) - Complete System Documentation

- v1.8.18: Added `cache.cleanup_on_startup` configuration option to control automatic cache cleanup behavior
```

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Configuration: cache.cleanup_on_startup

**Purpose:** Controls whether cache is automatically cleaned up when the application starts

**Type:** boolean

**Default Value:** `true`

**Location:** [`config/wp-pos-config.json`](../config/wp-pos-config.json:1)

**Example:**
```json
{
    "cache": {
        "enabled": true,
        "default_ttl": 300,
        "cleanup_on_startup": false
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- `true`: Cache is cleaned on every application start (removes expired entries)
- `false`: Cache cleanup only happens on scheduled intervals

**When to Disable:** 
- High-traffic environments where startup cleanup causes delays
- When using external cache management tools
- During development to preserve cache across restarts

**Related Code:**
- Implemented in [`cache-manager.php`](../api/cache-manager.php:45) line 45
- Called from [`index.php`](../index.php:12) during initialization
```

#### Step 2: Update Implementation
```bash
# Modify cache manager to use new config
apply_diff api/cache-manager.php
```

**Immediately After Tool Success:**

Update [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md:1):
```markdown
### Cache Manager Implementation

The [`WP-POS_Cache_Manager`](../api/cache-manager.php:15) class respects the `cleanup_on_startup` configuration:

```php
class WP-POS_Cache_Manager {
    public function __construct() {
        $config = $this->load_config();
        
        if ($config['cache']['cleanup_on_startup'] === true) {
            $this->cleanup_expired();
        }
    }
}
```

**Configuration-Aware Behavior:** Cache manager checks configuration before performing startup cleanup
```

### Counter-Examples (INCORRECT Approaches)

#### ‚ùå WRONG: Documenting Multiple Changes at Once
```markdown
<!-- DO NOT DO THIS -->
- v1.8.18: Added autocomplete, fixed cart bug, updated cache config, improved performance, refactored API, updated tests
```

**Why Wrong:** Too vague, no detail, loses track of individual changes

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Individual Documentation
```markdown
<!-- DO THIS INSTEAD -->
- v1.8.18: Implemented product search autocomplete with real-time suggestions using new /api/product-autocomplete.php endpoint
- v1.8.19: Fixed cart total calculation bug where discount percentages were added instead of subtracted
- v1.8.20: Added cache.cleanup_on_startup configuration option to control automatic cache cleanup behavior
```

#### ‚ùå WRONG: Documentation After All Changes
```
1. Create 5 new files
2. Modify 3 existing files
3. Test everything
4. Write all documentation at the end
```

**Why Wrong:** Violates real-time documentation protocol, risks missing details

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Documentation Between Each Change
```
1. Create api/endpoint1.php ‚Üí Document immediately
2. Create api/endpoint2.php ‚Üí Document immediately
3. Modify assets/js/main.js ‚Üí Document immediately
4. Test endpoint1 ‚Üí Document test results
5. Test endpoint2 ‚Üí Document test results
```

#### ‚ùå WRONG: Vague Version History
```markdown
- v1.8.18: Updated some stuff
- v1.8.19: Fixed things
# WP POS (WordPress Point of Sale) - Complete System Documentation

## System Overview

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode in configuration for detailed error information and logging.

### Routing System Troubleshooting
If views are not loading data properly:

1. **Check Global Functions**: Ensure all required functions are globally available:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Available functions:', {
     fetchOrders: typeof window.fetchOrders,
     fetchReportsData: typeof window.fetchReportsData,
     fetchSessions: typeof window.fetchSessions,
     renderStockList: typeof window.renderStockList,
     populateSettingsForm: typeof window.populateSettingsForm,
     renderHeldCarts: typeof window.renderHeldCarts
   });
   ```

2. **Verify Function Assignment**: Functions are assigned at the end of main.js execution
3. **Check Console Errors**: Look for "function not found" warnings in browser console
4. **URL Parameters**: Ensure views are accessed via proper URL parameters (`?view=view-name`)

### Monitoring
Use the built-in monitoring system to track system health, performance metrics, and error rates.

**Documentation Version**: 1.8.28
**Last Updated**: January 3, 2025
**System Status**: Production Ready
**Latest Update**: WP POS v1.8.28 - Incremented cache-busting version to force browser refresh and resolve cached v1.8.26 causing "cart is not defined" errors
**Maintenance Contact**: Development Team

## Version History

- v1.8.70: Unified settings save logic for consistent behavior - simplified [`api/settings.php:53-82`](api/settings.php:53-82) to treat ALL settings equally by comparing complete old vs new settings arrays ($old_settings !== $current_settings), removed complex separate keyboard settings detection logic, now keyboard booleans and receipt text fields use identical change detection mechanism, forces database update only when actual changes detected via PHP array comparison, consistent "Settings saved successfully" / "Settings are unchanged" messages for all field types, updated cache-busting version from v1.8.69 to v1.8.70 in [`index.php:25`](index.php:25)
- v1.8.69: Fixed virtual keyboard settings save logic to properly detect and persist changes - root cause was WordPress's `update_option()` returning false when new value equals old value, causing "Settings are unchanged" message, implemented explicit change detection in [`api/settings.php:64-89`](api/settings.php:64-89) that tracks whether keyboard settings (virtual_keyboard_enabled, virtual_keyboard_auto_show) have changed via strict boolean comparison, when keyboard settings change the function forces database update by passing false as third parameter to `update_option()` to bypass WordPress's value comparison, when only keyboard settings change settings now save successfully, updated cache-busting version from v1.8.68 to v1.8.69 in [`index.php:25`](index.php:25)
